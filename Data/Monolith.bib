abstract = {Cancer is a genetic disease caused by changes in gene expression resulting from somatic mutations and epigenetic changes. Although the probability of mutations is proportional with cell number and replication cycles, large bodied species do not develop cancer more frequently than smaller ones. This notion is known as Peto's paradox, and assumes stronger tumor suppression in larger animals. One of the possible tumor suppressor mechanisms involved could be replicative senescence caused by telomere shortening in the absence of telomerase activity. We analysed telomerase promoter activity and transcription factor binding in mammals to identify the key element of telomerase gene inactivation. We found that the GABPA transcription factor plays a key role in TERT regulation in somatic cells of small rodents, but its binding site is absent in larger beavers. Protein binding and reporter gene assays verify different use of this site in different species. The presence or absence of the GABPA TF site in TERT promoters of rodents correlates with TERT promoter activity; thus it could determine whether replicative senescence plays a tumor suppressor role in these species, which could be in direct relation with body mass. The GABPA TF binding sites that contribute to TERT activity in somatic cells of rodents are analogous to those mutated in human tumors, which activate telomerase by a non-ALT mechanism.},

abstract = {The reverse transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) initiates upon annealing of the 30-18-nt of tRNALys3 onto the primer binding site (PBS) in viral RNA (vRNA). Additional intermolecular interactions between tRNALys3 and vRNA have been reported, but their functions remain unclear. Here, we show that abolishing one potential interaction, the A-rich loop: tRNALys3 anticodon interaction in the HIV-1 MAL strain, led to a decrease in viral infectivity and reduced the synthesis of reverse transcription products in newly infected cells. In vitro biophysical and functional experiments revealed that disruption of the extended interaction resulted in an increased affinity for reverse transcriptase (RT) and enhanced primer extension efficiency. In the absence of deoxyribose nucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), vRNA was degraded by the RNaseH activity of RT, and the degradation rate was slower in the complex with the extended interaction. Consistently, the loss of vRNA integrity was detected in virions containing A-rich loop mutations. Similar results were observed in the HIV-1 NL4.3 strain, and we show that the nucleocapsid (NC) protein is necessary to promote the extended vRNA: tRNALys3 interactions in vitro. In summary, our data revealed that the additional intermolecular interaction between tRNALys3 and vRNA is likely a conserved mechanism among various HIV-1 strains and protects the vRNA from RNaseH degradation in mature virions.},

abstract = {Histone methyltransferases of the nuclear receptor-binding SET domain protein (NSD) family, including NSD1, NSD2 and NSD3, have crucial roles in chromatin regulation and are implicated in oncogenesis1,2. NSD enzymes exhibit an autoinhibitory state that is relieved by binding to nucleosomes, enabling dimethylation of histone H3 at Lys36 (H3K36)3–7. However, the molecular basis that underlies this mechanism is largely unknown. Here we solve the cryo-electron microscopy structures of NSD2 and NSD3 bound to mononucleosomes. We find that binding of NSD2 and NSD3 to mononucleosomes causes DNA near the linker region to unwrap, which facilitates insertion of the catalytic core between the histone octamer and the unwrapped segment of DNA. A network of DNA- and histone-specific contacts between NSD2 or NSD3 and the nucleosome precisely defines the position of the enzyme on the nucleosome, explaining the specificity of methylation to H3K36. Intermolecular contacts between NSD proteins and nucleosomes are altered by several recurrent cancer-associated mutations in NSD2 and NSD3. NSDs that contain these mutations are catalytically hyperactive in vitro and in cells, and their ectopic expression promotes the proliferation of cancer cells and the growth of xenograft tumours. Together, our research provides molecular insights into the nucleosome-based recognition and histone-modification mechanisms of NSD2 and NSD3, which could lead to strategies for therapeutic targeting of proteins of the NSD family.},

abstract = {Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus from the Bunyaviridae family that causes high rates of mortality and morbidity in humans and ruminant animals. Previous studies indicated that DEAD-box helicase 17 (DDX17) restricts RVFV replication by recognizing two primary non-coding RNAs in the S-segment of the genome: the intergenic region (IGR) and 50 non-coding region (NCR). However, we lack molecular insights into the direct binding of DDX17 with RVFV non-coding RNAs and information on the unwinding of both non-coding RNAs by DDX17. Therefore, we performed an extensive biophysical analysis of the DDX17 helicase domain (DDX17135–555) and RVFV non-coding RNAs, IGR and 5' NCR. The homogeneity studies using analytical ultracentrifugation indicated that DDX17135–555, IGR, and 5' NCR are pure. Next, we performed small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments, which suggested that DDX17 and both RNAs are homogenous as well. SAXS analysis also demonstrated that DDX17 is globular to an extent, whereas the RNAs adopt an extended conformation in solution. Subsequently, microscale thermophoresis (MST) experiments were performed to investigate the direct binding of DDX17 to the non-coding RNAs. The MST experiments demonstrated that DDX17 binds with the IGR and 5' NCR with a dissociation constant of 5.77 ± 0.15 µM and 9.85 ± 0.11 µM, respectively. As DDX17135–555 is an RNA helicase, we next determined if it could unwind IGR and NCR. We developed a helicase assay using MST and fluorescently-labeled oligos, which suggested DDX17135–555 can unwind both RNAs. Overall, our study provides direct evidence of DDX17135–555 interacting with and unwinding RVFV non-coding regions},

abstract = {Flavivirus genus includes many deadly viruses such as the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). The 5՛ terminal regions (TR) of flaviviruses interact with human proteins and such interactions are critical for viral replication. One of the human proteins identified to interact with the 5՛ TR of JEV is the DEAD-box helicase, DDX3X. In this study, we in vitro transcribed the 50 TR of JEV and demonstrated its direct interaction with recombinant DDX3X (Kd of 1.66 0.21 $\mu$M) using microscale thermophoresis (MST). Due to the proposed structural similarities of 5՛ and 3՛ TRs of flaviviruses, we investigated if the ZIKV 50 TR could also interact with human DDX3X. Our MST studies suggested that DDX3X recognizes ZIKV 50 TR with a Kd of 7.05 0.75 $\mu$M. Next, we performed helicase assays that suggested that the binding of DDX3X leads to the unwinding of JEV and ZIKV 5՛ TRs. Overall, our data indicate, for the first time, that DDX3X can directly bind and unwind in vitro transcribed flaviviral TRs. In summary, our work indicates that DDX3X could be further explored as a therapeutic target to inhibit Flaviviral replication.},

Olfactory cues guide insects to their hosts, and are thus responsible for disease transmission. Understanding the molecular basis of insect olfaction could facilitate the development of interventions. The first step is to heterologously overexpress and purify insect olfactory receptors (ORs). This is challenging, as ORs are membrane proteins. Here, we show that insect ORs and their co-receptor can be expressed in an E. coli cell-free system. After immunoaffinity chromatography, the ORs are {\~{}}95{\%} pure, and up to 1 mg/10 ml reaction is obtained. Circular dichroism together with microscale thermophoresis indicate that each receptor is properly folded, and can bind its respective ligand. This is the first time insect ORs have been expressed in an E. coli system. The methods described here could facilitate future structure-function studies, which may aid in developments to alleviate the suffering of millions caused by insect-transmitted diseases.},

abstract = {The enzyme protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR, EC 1.3.1.33) has a key role in plant development. It catalyzes one of the later steps in chlorophyll synthesis, the light-induced reduction of protochlorophyllide (PChlide) into chlorophyllide (Chlide) in the presence of NADPH. Two isozymes of plant POR, POR A and POR B from barley, which differ in their function during plant life, are compared with respect to their substrate binding affinity, catalytic efficiency, and catalytic mechanism. POR B as compared to POR A shows an 5-fold higher binding affinity for protochlorophyllide a (PChlide) and an about 6-fold higher catalytic efficiency measured as ratio kcat/KM. Based on the reaction intermediates, which can be trapped at low temperatures the same reaction mechanism operates in both POR A and POR B. In contrast to results reported for POR enzymes from cyanobacteria, the initial light-driven step, which occurs at temperatures below 180 K already involves the full chemistry of the photoreduction and yields the reaction product, Chlide, in an enzyme-bound form. The subsequent dark reactions, which include cofactor (NADP+) release and cofactor (NADPH) rebinding, show different temperature dependencies for POR A and POR B and suggest a higher conformational flexibility of POR B in the surrounding of the active center. Both the higher substrate binding affinity and well-adapted enzyme dynamics are held responsible for the increased catalytic activity of POR B as compared to POR A.},

The thiosemicarbazone Triapine is an efficient R2 inhibitor, which has entered approximately 20 clinical trials. Thiosemicarbazones are supposed to exert their biological effects through effectively binding transition-metal ions. In this study, six iminodiacetate-thiosemicarbazones able to form transition-metal complexes, as well as six dicopper(II) complexes, were synthesized and fully characterized by analytical, spectroscopic techniques (IR, UV-vis; 1H and 13C NMR), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and X-ray diffraction. The antiproliferative effects were examined in several human cancer and one noncancerous cell lines. Several of the compounds showed high cytotoxicity and marked selectivity for cancer cells. On the basis of this, and on molecular docking calculations one lead dicopper(II) complex and one thiosemicarbazone were chosen for in vitro analysis as potential R2 inhibitors. Their interaction with R2 and effect on the Fe(III)2-Y. cofactor were characterized by microscale thermophoresis, and two spectroscopic techniques, namely, electron paramagnetic resonance and UV-vis spectroscopy. Our findings suggest that several of the synthesized proligands and copper(II) complexes are effective antiproliferative agents in several cancer cell lines, targeting RNR, which deserve further investigation as potential anticancer drugs.},

abstract = {During rotavirus infection, replication and packaging of the viral genome occur in viral factories, termed viroplasms. The viral nonstructural protein NSP5 is a major building block of viroplasms; it recruits the viral polymerase VP1, the core protein VP2, and the ATPase NSP2 inside the viroplasm to form the viral replication complex. Here we report that NSP5 is a unique viral metalloprotein that coordinates a [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster as demonstrated by the metal and labile sulfide contents, UV-visible light absorption, and electron paramagnetic resonance. Point mutations in NSP5 allowed us to identify C171 and C174, arranged in a CXC motif, as essential residues for cluster coordination. When coexpressed with NSP2, an NSP5 mutant devoid of the iron-sulfur cluster still forms viroplasm-like structures. The cluster is therefore neither involved in the interaction with NSP2 nor in the formation of viroplasm-like structures and thus presumably in viroplasm formation. Finally, we show using microscale thermophoresis that the iron-sulfur cluster modulates the affinity of NSP5 for single-stranded RNA. Because the cluster is near the binding sites of both the polymerase VP1 and the ATPase NSP2, we anticipate that this cluster is crucial for NSP5 functions, in either packaging or replication of the viral genome.},

abstract = {Activity-dependent neurite outgrowth is a highly complex, regulated process with important implications for neuronal circuit remodeling in development as well as in seizure-induced sprouting in epilepsy. Recent work has linked outgrowth to collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), an intracellular phosphoprotein originally identified as axon guidance and growth cone collapse protein. The neurite outgrowth promoting function of CRMP2 is regulated by its phosphorylation state. In this study, depolarization (potassium chloride)-driven activity increased the level of active CRMP2 by decreasing its phosphorylation by GSK3{\&}{\#}x3B2; via a reduction in priming by Cdk5. To determine the contribution of CRMP2 in activity-driven neurite outgrowth, we screened a limited set of compounds for their ability to reduce neurite outgrowth but not modify voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) biophysical properties. This led to the identification of (S)-lacosamide ((S)-LCM), a stereoisomer of the clinically used antiepileptic drug (R)-LCM (Vimpat{\&}{\#}xAE;), as a novel tool for preferentially targeting CRMP2-mediated neurite outgrowth. Whereas (S)-LCM was ineffective in targeting VGSCs, the presumptive pharmacological targets of (R)-LCM, (S)-LCM was more efficient than (R)-LCM in subverting neurite outgrowth. Biomolecular interaction analyses revealed that (S)-LCM bound to wildtype CRMP2 with low micromolar affinity, similar to (R)-LCM. Through the use of this novel tool, the activity-dependent increase in neurite outgrowth observed following depolarization was characterized to be reliant on CRMP2 function. Knockdown of CRMP2 by siRNA in cortical neurons resulted in reduced CRMP2-dependent neurite outgrowth; incubation with (S)-LCM phenocopied this effect. Other CRMP2-mediated processes were unaffected. (S)-LCM subverted neurite outgrowth not by affecting the canonical CRMP2-tubulin association but rather by impairing the ability of CRMP2 to promote tubulin polymerization, events that are perfunctory for neurite outgrowth. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in the phosphorylation state of CRMP2 are a major contributing factor in activity-dependent regulation of neurite outgrowth.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic cell homeostasis requires transfer of cellular components among organelles and relies on membrane fusion catalyzed by SNARE proteins. Inactive SNARE bundles are reactivated by hexameric N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, vesicle-fusing ATPase (Sec18/NSF)-driven disassembly that enables a new round of membrane fusion. We previously found that phosphatidic acid (PA) binds Sec18 and thereby sequesters it from SNAREs and that PA dephosphorylation dissociates Sec18 from the membrane, allowing it to engage SNARE complexes. We now report that PA also induces conformational changes in Sec18 protomers and that hexameric Sec18 cannot bind PA membranes. Molecular dynamics (MD) analyses revealed that the D1 and D2 domains of Sec18 contain PA-binding sites and that the residues needed for PA binding are masked in hexameric Sec18. Importantly, these simulations also disclosed that a major conformational change occurs in the linker region between the D1 and D2 domains, which is distinct from the conformational changes that occur in hexameric Sec18 during SNARE priming. Together, these findings indicate that PA regulates Sec18 function by altering its architecture and stabilizing membrane-bound Sec18 protomers.},

abstract = {Inorganic phosphate is the major bioavailable form of the essential nutrient phosphorus. However, the concentration of phosphate in most natural habitats is low enough to limit microbial growth. Under phosphate-depleted conditions some bacteria utilise phosphite and hypophosphite as alternative sources of phosphorus, but the molecular basis of reduced phosphorus acquisition from the environment is not fully understood. Here, we present crystal structures and ligand binding affinities of periplasmic binding proteins from bacterial phosphite and hypophosphite ATP-binding cassette transporters. We reveal that phosphite and hypophosphite specificity results from a combination of steric selection and the presence of a P-H{\ldots}$\pi$ interaction between the ligand and a conserved aromatic residue in the ligand-binding pocket. The characterisation of high affinity and specific transporters has implications for the marine phosphorus redox cycle, and might aid the use of phosphite as an alternative phosphorus source in biotechnological, industrial and agricultural applications.},

Using tissue-specific expression of proteinase inhibitors as a tool to overcome functional redundancy, SBT activity was found to be required for the maturation of IDA (INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION), a peptide signal for the abscission of floral organs in Arabidopsis. We identified three SBTs that process the IDA precursor in vitro, and this processing was shown to be required for the formation of mIDA as the endogenous signaling peptide in vivo. We conclude that SBTs act as pro-hormone convertases in plants, and that several functionally redundant SBTs contribute to signal biogenesis.},

Previous work in our group has identified a small peptide (NOP-1) derived from the nuclear localization signal of the Arabidopsis ethylene regulator ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE-2 (EIN2) C-terminal part as efficient inhibitor of ethylene responses. Here, we show that NOP-1 is also able to efficiently disrupt EIN2-ETR1 complex formation in tomato, indicating that the NOP-1 inhibition mode is conserved across plant species. Surface application of NOP-1 on green tomato fruits delays ripening similar to known inhibitors of ethylene perception (MCP) and ethylene biosynthesis (AVG). Fruits treated with NOP-1 showed similar ethylene production as untreated controls underlining that NOP-1 blocks ethylene signaling by targeting an essential interaction in this pathway, while having no effect on ethylene biosynthesis.},

abstract = {Cell-surface-receptor binding by influenza viruses is a key determinant of their transmissibility, both from avian and animal species to humans as well as from human to human. Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses that are a threat to public health have been observed to acquire affinity for human receptors, and transmissible-mutant-selection experiments have identified a virus that is transmissible in ferrets, the generally accepted experimental model for influenza in humans. Here, our quantitative biophysical measurements of the receptor-binding properties of haemagglutinin (HA) from the transmissible mutant indicate a small increase in affinity for human receptor and a marked decrease in affinity for avian receptor. From analysis of virus and HA binding data we have derived an algorithm that predicts virus avidity from the affinity of individual HA-receptor interactions. It reveals that the transmissible-mutant virus has a 200-fold preference for binding human over avian receptors. The crystal structure of the transmissible-mutant HA in complex with receptor analogues shows that it has acquired the ability to bind human receptor in the same folded-back conformation as seen for HA from the 1918, 1957 (ref. 4), 1968 (ref. 5) and 2009 (ref. 6) pandemic viruses. This binding mode is substantially different from that by which non-transmissible wild-type H5 virus HA binds human receptor. The structure of the complex also explains how the change in preference from avian to human receptors arises from the Gln226Leu substitution, which facilitates binding to human receptor but restricts binding to avian receptor. Both features probably contribute to the acquisition of transmissibility by this mutant virus.},

In this study, we report a one-pot aqueous synthesis of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA)-functionalized CdTe/CdS/ZnS quantum dots (Qdots) in the presence of thiol-terminated methoxy polyethylene glycol (mPEG) molecules as a surface coordinating ligand. The resulting mPEG?Qdots were characterized by using ? potential, FTIR, thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, and microscale thermophoresis (MST) studies. We investigated the effect of mPEG molecules and their grafting density on the Qdots photophysical properties, colloidal stability, protein binding affinity, and in vitro cellular toxicity. Moreover, cellular binding features of the resulting Qdots were examined by using three-dimensional (3D) tumor-like spheroids, and the results were discussed in detail. Promisingly, mPEG ligands were found to increase colloidal stability of Qdots, reduce adsorption of proteins to the Qdot surface, and mitigate Qdot-induced side effects to a great extent. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy studies revealed that PEGylated Qdots exhibited distinctive cellular interactions with respect to their mPEG grafting density. As a result, mPEG molecules demonstrated a minimal effect on the ZnS shell deposition and the Qdot fluorescence efficiency at a low mPEG density, whereas they showed pronounced effect on Qdot colloidal stability, protein binding affinity, cytotoxicity, and nonspecific binding at a higher mPEG grafting amount.},

In this study Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)-binding aptamers were conjugated with quantum dot molecules.

abstract = {Phosphorus acquisition is critical for life. In low phosphate conditions, some species of bacteria have evolved mechanisms to import reduced phosphorus compounds, such as phosphite and hypophosphite, as alternative phosphorus sources. Uptake is facilitated by high-affinity periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) that bind cargo in the periplasm and shuttle it to an ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-transporter in the bacterial inner membrane. PtxB and HtxB are the PBPs responsible for binding phosphite and hypophosphite, respectively. They recognize the P-H bond of phosphite/hypophosphite via a conserved P-H...$\pi$ interaction, which confers nanomolar dissociation constants for their respective ligands. PtxB also has a low-level binding affinity for phosphate and hypophosphite, whilst HtxB can facilitate phosphite uptake in vivo. However, HtxB does not bind phosphate, thus the HtxBCDE transporter has recently been successfully exploited for biocontainment of genetically modified organisms by phosphite-dependent growth. Here we use a combination of X-ray crystallography, NMR and Microscale Thermophoresis to show that phosphite binding to HtxB depends on the protonation state of the ligand, suggesting that pH may effect the efficiency of phosphite uptake by HtxB in biotechnology applications.},

FAF1 itself also has emerging roles in other cell-cycle pathways and displays altered expression levels in various cancer cell lines. We have performed a detailed study the p97-FAF1 interaction.

abstract = {The capacity of Plasmodium falciparum parasitized erythrocytes (pRBC) to adhere to the endothelial lining in the microvasculature and to red blood cells (RBC) is associated with the virulence of the parasite, the pathogenesis and development of severe malaria. Rosetting, the binding of uninfected RBC to pRBC, is frequently observed in individuals with severe malaria and is mediated by the N-terminal NTS-DBL1$\alpha$ domain of the adhesin Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) expressed at the surface of the pRBC. Heparan sulfate has been suggested to be an important receptor for the NTS-DBL1$\alpha$ variant IT4var60 expressed by the parasite FCR3S1.2. Here, we have determined the binding site of NTS-DBL1$\alpha$ (IT4var60) to the RBC and heparin using a set of recombinant, mutated proteins expressed in and purified from E. coli. All the variants were studied for their ability to bind to RBC, their capacities to disrupt FCR3S1.2 rosettes, their affinities for heparin and their binding to rosette-disruptive mAbs. Our results suggest that NTS-DBL1$\alpha$ mediates binding to RBC through a limited number of basic amino acid residues localized on the surface of subdomains 1 (SD1) and 2 (SD2). The SD2-binding site is localized in close proximity to one of two previously identified binding sites in the rosetting PfEMP1 of the parasite PaloAlto-varO. The binding site in SD2 of NTS-DBL1$\alpha$ could represent a template for the development of anti-rosetting drugs.},

abstract = {The analysis of binding interactions between small molecules and biopolymers is important for understanding biological processes. While fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) requires fluorescence labeling on the small molecule, which often interferes with binding, in microscale thermophoresis (MST) the label can be placed on the biopolymer. Ribozymes have not been analyzed by MST so far. The Diels-Alderase ribozyme (DAse) is a true catalyst, facilitating the Diels-Alder reaction between two free small substrates, anthracene dienes, and maleimide dienophiles. Despite high efforts, the determination of the dissociation constant (KD) of maleimide dienophiles to the DAse by FCS has been unsuccessful. Here, we determined the binding interactions of the DAse to its substrates and the Diels-Alder product using MST. The results supported a positive cooperativity for substrate binding to the DAse. By varying the temperature, we furthermore studied the thermodynamics of dienophile dissociation. The entropic contribution was found to be the energetic driving force for the binding of the dienophile to the DAse.},

abstract = {Coronaviruses pose serious health threats to humans and other animals. Understanding the mechanisms of their replication has important implications for global health and economic stability. Nonstructural protein 9 (nsp9) is an essential RNA binding protein for coronavirus replication. However, the mechanisms of the dimerization and nucleic acid binding of nsp9 remain elusive. Here, we report four crystal structures, including wild-type porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV) nsp9, PDCoV nsp9-$\Delta$N7 (N-terminal 7 amino acids deleted), wild-type porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) nsp9, and PEDV nsp9-C59A mutant. These structures reveal the diverse dimerization forms of coronavirus nsp9. We first found that the N-finger of nsp9 from PDCoV plays a critical role in dimerization. Meanwhile, PEDV nsp9 is distinguished by the presence of a disulfide bond in the dimer interface. Interestingly, size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation analyses indicate that the PDCoV nsp9-$\Delta$N7 and PEDV nsp9-C59A mutants are monomeric in solution. In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assays and microscale thermophoresis analysis indicate that the monomeric forms of PDCoV nsp9 and PEDV nsp9 still have nucleic acid binding affinity, although it is lower than that of the wild type. Our results show that the diverse dimerization forms of coronavirus nsp9 proteins enhance their nucleic acid binding affinity.},

abstract = {Amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered to be mediated by phosphorylated tau protein. In contrast, we found that, at least in early disease, site-specific phosphorylation of tau inhibited A$\beta$ toxicity. This specific tau phosphorylation was mediated by the neuronal p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase p38$\gamma$ and interfered with postsynaptic excitotoxic signaling complexes engaged by A$\beta$. Accordingly, depletion of p38$\gamma$ exacerbated neuronal circuit aberrations, cognitive deficits, and premature lethality in a mouse model of AD, whereas increasing the activity of p38$\gamma$ abolished these deficits. Furthermore, mimicking site-specific tau phosphorylation alleviated A$\beta$-induced neuronal death and offered protection from excitotoxicity. Our work provides insights into postsynaptic processes in AD pathogenesis and challenges a purely pathogenic role of tau phosphorylation in neuronal toxicity.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

The affinities between the loop of MBs and the complementary ssDNAs in the binding system were varied, determined and optimized by MST in the presence or absence of Hg2+. It suggested that the relative low background could be obtained when the number of mismatches of ssDNA was four and in the present of Hg2+ displayed strong recovery of fluorescence. The lowest detection limit of Hg2+ was 3 nM which was below the maximum contaminant level defined by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (10 nM). The working range was 5–320 nM with negligible possible interference from the different background composition of water samples by optimization of the binding conditions. Through evaluating by MST, the molecular interaction mechanism was elaborated and the rapid, sensitive and selective detection of Hg2+ was achieved by the designed MB-binding system. It herein has great potential for appraising and analyzing molecular interaction among the interactants.},

This fundamental biological event depends on the species-specific interaction between rapidly evolving counterpart molecules on the gametes. We report biochemical, crystallographic, and mutational studies of domain repeats 1–3 of invertebrate egg coat protein VERL and their interaction with cognate sperm protein lysin. VERL repeats fold like the functionally essential N-terminal repeat of mammalian sperm receptor ZP2, whose structure is also described here. Whereas sequence-divergent repeat 1 does not bind lysin, repeat 3 binds it non-species specifically via a high-affinity, largely hydrophobic interface. Due to its intermediate binding affinity, repeat 2 selectively interacts with lysin from the same species. Exposure of a highly positively charged surface of VERL-bound lysin suggests that complex formation both disrupts the organization of egg coat filaments and triggers their electrostatic repulsion, thereby opening a hole for sperm penetration and fusion.},

Microscale thermophoresis (MST) is a powerful new method for the quantitative analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) with low sample consumption. In addition, one of the major advantages of this technique is that no tedious purification step is necessary to access the protein of interest. Here, we describe a protocol using MST to determine the binding affinity of the PD-1/PD-L1 couple, which is involved in tumour escape processes, without purification of the target protein from cell lysates. The method requires the overexpression of fluorescent proteins in CHO-K1 cells and describes the optimal conditions for determining the dissociation constant. The protocol has a variety of potential applications in studying the interactions of these proteins with small molecules and demonstrates that MST is a valuable method for studying the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway.},

abstract = {The nuclear envelope is a double membrane that separates the nucleus from the cytoplasm. The inner nuclear membrane (INM) functions in essential nuclear processes including chromatin organization and regulation of gene expression. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum and is the site of membrane protein synthesis. Protein homeostasis in this compartment is ensured by endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathways that in yeast involve the integral membrane E3 ubiquitin ligases Hrd1 and Doa10 operating with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc6 and Ubc7 (refs 2, 3). However, little is known about protein quality control at the INM. Here we describe a protein degradation pathway at the INM in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mediated by the Asi complex consisting of the RING domain proteins Asi1 and Asi3 (ref. 4). We report that the Asi complex functions together with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc6 and Ubc7 to degrade soluble and integral membrane proteins. Genetic evidence suggests that the Asi ubiquitin ligase defines a pathway distinct from, but complementary to, ERAD. Using unbiased screening with a novel genome-wide yeast library based on a tandem fluorescent protein timer, we identify more than 50 substrates of the Asi, Hrd1 and Doa10 E3 ubiquitin ligases. We show that the Asi ubiquitin ligase is involved in degradation of mislocalized integral membrane proteins, thus acting to maintain and safeguard the identity of the INM.},

abstract = {Post-weaning diarrhea and edema disease caused by F18 fimbriated E. coli are important diseases in newly weaned piglets and lead to severe production losses in farming industry. Protective treatments against these infections have thus far limited efficacy. In this study we generated nanobodies directed against the lectin domain of the F18 fimbrial adhesin FedF and showed in an in vitro adherence assay that four unique nanobodies inhibit the attachment of F18 fimbriated E. coli bacteria to piglet enterocytes. Crystallization of the FedF lectin domain with the most potent inhibitory nanobodies revealed their mechanism of action. These either competed with the binding of the blood group antigen receptor on the FedF surface or induced a conformational change in which the CDR3 region of the nanobody displaces the D″-E loop adjacent to the binding site. This D″-E loop was previously shown to be required for the interaction between F18 fimbriated bacteria and blood group antigen receptors in a membrane context. This work demonstrates the feasibility of inhibiting the attachment of fimbriated pathogens by employing nanobodies directed against the adhesin domain.},

abstract = {Peptide-mediated cell-to-cell signaling has crucial roles in coordination and definition of cellular functions in plants. Peptide-receptor matching is important for understanding the mechanisms underlying peptide-mediated signaling. Here we report the structure-guided identification of root meristem growth factor (RGF) receptors important for plant development. An assay based on a signature ligand recognition motif (Arg-x-Arg) conserved in a subfamily of leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs) identified the functionally uncharacterized LRR-RK At4g26540 as a receptor of RGF1 (RGFR1). We further solved the crystal structure of RGF1 in complex with the LRR domain of RGFR1 at a resolution of 2.6 A, which reveals that the Arg-x-Gly-Gly (RxGG) motif is responsible for specific recognition of the sulfate group of RGF1 by RGFR1. Based on the RxGG motif, we identified additional four RGFRs. Participation of the five RGFRs in RGF-induced signaling is supported by biochemical and genetic data. We also offer evidence showing that SERKs function as co-receptors for RGFs. Taken together, our study identifies RGF receptors and co-receptors that can link RGF signals with their downstream components and provides a proof of principle for structure-based matching of LRR-RKs with their peptide ligands.},

We report a complete high-resolution structure of the 200 kDa $\alpha$-actinin-2 dimer from striated muscle and explore its functional implications on the biochemical and cellular level. The structure provides insight into the phosphoinositide-based mechanism controlling its interaction with sarcomeric proteins such as titin, lays a foundation for studying the impact of pathogenic mutations at molecular resolution, and is likely to be broadly relevant for the regulation of spectrin-like proteins.},

We used NMR, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and microscale thermophoresis (MST) methods to investigate the binding of these compounds to tau K18; only one showed unambiguous interaction with tau K18. Several near neighbors of this compound were synthesized and their interactions with tau K18 characterized using additional NMR methods, including 1D ligand-observed NMR, di usion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) and 19F NMR. This study demonstrates that it is possible to detect and characterize IDP–ligand interactions using biophysical methods. However, care must be taken to account for possible artefacts, particularly the impact of compound solubility and where the protein has to be immobilized.},

abstract = {Amyloid fibrils are a hallmark of a range of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. A detailed understanding of the physico-chemical properties of the different aggregated forms of proteins, and of their interactions with other compounds of diagnostic or therapeutic interest, is crucial for devising effective strategies against such diseases. Protein aggregates are situated at the boundary between soluble and insoluble structures, and are challenging to study because classical biophysical techniques, such as scattering, spectroscopic and calorimetric methods, are not well adapted for their study. Here we present a detailed characterization of the thermophoretic behavior of different forms of the protein $\alpha$-synuclein, whose aggregation is associated with Parkinson's disease. Thermophoresis is the directed net diffusional flux of molecules and colloidal particles in a temperature gradient. Because of their low volume requirements and rapidity, analytical methods based on this effect have considerable potential for high throughput screening for drug discovery. In this paper we rationalize and describe in quantitative terms the thermophoretic behavior of monomeric, oligomeric and fibrillar forms of $\alpha$-synuclein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that microscale thermophoresis (MST) is a valuable method for screening for ligands and binding partners of even such highly challenging samples as supramolecular protein aggregates.},

abstract = {Phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) on a single tyrosine residue in response to growth factors, cytokines, interferons, and oncogenes activates its dimerization, translocation to the nucleus, binding to the interferon gamma (gamma)-activated sequence (GAS) DNA-binding site and activation of transcription of target genes. STAT3 is constitutively phosphorylated in various cancers and drives gene expression from GAS-containing promoters to promote tumorigenesis. Recently, roles for unphosphorylated STAT3 (U-STAT3) have been described in response to cytokine stimulation, in cancers, and in maintenance of heterochromatin stability. However, the mechanisms underlying U-STAT3 binding to DNA has not been fully investigated. Here, we explore STAT3-DNA interactions by atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. We observed that U-STAT3 molecules bind to the GAS DNA-binding site as dimers and monomers. In addition, we observed that U-STAT3 binds to AT-rich DNA sequence sites and recognizes specific DNA structures, such as 4-way junctions and DNA nodes, within negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA. These structures are important for chromatin organization and our data suggest a role for U-STAT3 as a chromatin/genome organizer. Unexpectedly, we found that a C-terminal truncated 67.5-kDa STAT3 isoform recognizes single-stranded spacers within cruciform structures that also have a role in chromatin organization and gene expression. This isoform appears to be abundant in the nuclei of cancer cells and, therefore, may have a role in regulation of gene expression. Taken together, our data highlight novel mechanisms by which U-STAT3 binds to DNA and supports U-STAT3 function as a transcriptional activator and a chromatin/genomic organizer.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been dramatic growth in the study of RNA. RNA has gone from being known as an intermediate in the central dogma of molecular biology to a molecule with a large diversity of structure and function that is involved in all aspects of biology. As new functions are rapidly discovered, it has become clear that there is a need for RNA-targeting small molecule probes to investigate RNA biology and clarify the potential for therapeutics based on RNA–small molecule interactions. While a host of techniques exist to measure RNA–small molecule interactions, many of these have drawbacks that make them intractable for routine use and are often not broadly applicable. A newer technology called microscale thermophoresis (MST), which measures the directed migration of a molecule and/or molecule–ligand complex along a temperature gradient, can be used to measure binding affinities using very small amounts of sample. The high sensitivity of this technique enables measurement of affinity constants in the nanomolar and micromolar range. Here, we demonstrate how MST can be used to study a range of biologically relevant RNA interactions, including peptide–RNA interactions, RNA–small molecule interactions, and displacement of an RNA-bound peptide by a small molecule.},

abstract = {Introduction: Drug plasma protein binding remains highly relevant to research and drug development, making the assessment and profiling of compound affinity to plasma proteins essential to drug discovery efforts. Although there are a number of fully-characterized methods, they lack the throughput to handle large numbers of compounds. As the evaluation of adsorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion is addressed earlier in the drug development timeline, the need for higher-throughput methods has grown. Areas Covered: This review will highlight recent developments on methods for profiling drug plasma binding, with an emphasis on fluorescent probes and emerging high-throughput methodologies. Expert Opinion: There have been a number of high-throughput assays developed in recent years to meet the scaled up demands for compound profiling. Ultimately, the selection of assay technology relies on a number of factors, such as capabilities of the laboratory and the breadth and amount of data required. Fluorescent probe displacement assays are highly flexible and amenable to high-throughput screening, easily scaling up to handle large compound libraries. Recent developments in fluorescence technologies, such as homogenous time-resolved fluorescence and probes utilizing the aggregation-induced emission effect, have improved the sensitivity of these assays. Other technologies, such as microscale thermophoresis and quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling, are gaining popularity as alternative techniques for drug plasma protein binding characterization.},

abstract = {Protein aggregation remains a major area of focus in the production of monoclonal antibodies. Improving the intrinsic properties of antibodies can improve manufacturability, attrition rates, safety, formulation, titers, immunogenicity, and solubility. Here, we explore the potential of predicting and reducing the aggregation propensity of monoclonal antibodies, based on the identification of aggregation-prone regions and their contribution to the thermodynamic stability of the protein. Although aggregation-prone regions are thought to occur in the antigen binding region to drive hydrophobic binding with antigen, we were able to rationally design variants that display a marked decrease in aggregation propensity while retaining antigen binding through the introduction of artificial aggregation gatekeeper residues. The reduction in aggregation propensity was accompanied by an increase in expression titer, showing that reducing protein aggregation is beneficial throughout the development process. The data presented show that this approach can significantly reduce liabilities in novel therapeutic antibodies and proteins, leading to a more efficient path to clinical studies.},

abstract = {The majority of proteins that are secreted across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane leave the cell via the Sec pathway, which in its minimal form consists of the dimeric ATP-driven motor protein SecA that associates with the protein-conducting membrane pore SecYEG. Some Gram-positive bacteria contain two homologues of SecA, termed SecA1 and SecA2. SecA1 is the essential housekeeping protein, whereas SecA2 is not essential but is involved in the translocation of a subset of proteins, including various virulence factors. Some SecA2 containing bacteria also harbor a homologous SecY2 protein that may form a separate translocase. Interestingly, mycobacteria contain only one SecY protein and thus both SecA1 and SecA2 are required to interact with SecYEG, either individually or together as a heterodimer. In order to address whether SecA1 and SecA2 cooperate during secretion of SecA2 dependent proteins, we examined the oligomeric state of SecA1 and SecA2 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and their interactions with SecA2 and the cognate SecA1, respectively. We conclude that both SecA1 and SecA2 individually form homodimers in solution but when both proteins are present simultaneously, they form dissociable heterodimers.},

abstract = {High-temperature requirement A1 (HTRA1) is a secreted serine protease reported to play a role in the development of several cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Still, the mechanism underlying the disease processes largely remains undetermined. In age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a common cause of vision impairment and blindness in industrialized societies, two synonymous polymorphisms (rs1049331:C{\textgreater}T, and rs2293870:G{\textgreater}T) in exon 1 of the HTRA1 genewere associated with a high risk to develop disease. Here, we show that the two polymorphisms result in a protein with altered thermophoretic properties upon heat-induced unfolding, trypsin accessibility and secretion behavior, suggesting unique structural features of the AMD-risk-associated HTRA1 protein. Applying MicroScale Thermophoresis and protease digestion analysis, we demonstrate direct binding and proteolysis of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) by normal HTRA1 but not the AMD-risk-associated isoform. As a consequence, both HTRA1 isoforms strongly differed in their ability to control TGF-beta mediated signaling, as revealed by reporter assays targeting the TGF-beta 1-induced serpin peptidase inhibitor (SERPINE1, alias PAI-1) promoter. In addition, structurally altered HTRA1 led to an impaired autocrine TGF-beta signaling in microglia, as measured by a strong down-regulation of downstream effectors of the TGF-beta cascade such as phosphorylated SMAD2 and PAI-1 expression. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the effects of two synonymous HTRA1 variants on protein structure and protein interaction with TGF-beta 1. As a consequence, this leads to an impairment of TGF-beta signaling and microglial regulation. Functional implications of the altered properties on AMD pathogenesis remain to be clarified.},

abstract = {The interaction between the renal water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) and the lysosomal trafficking regulator-interacting protein LIP5 targets AQP2 to multivesicular bodies and facilitates lysosomal degradation. This interaction is part of a process which controls AQP2 apical membrane abundance in a vasopressin-dependent manner, allowing for urine volume adjustment. Vasopressin regulates phosphorylation at four sites within the AQP2 C-terminus (S256, S261, S264, T269), of which S256 is crucial and sufficient for AQP2 translocation from storage vesicles to the apical membrane. However, whether AQP2 phosphorylation modulates AQP2-LIP5 complex affinity is unknown. Here using far-western blot analysis and microscale thermophoresis (MST) to show that the AQP2 binds LIP5 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. We constructed five phospho-mimicking mutants (S256E, S261E, S264E, T269E, S256E/T269E) and a C-terminal truncation mutant (DeltaP242) that lacked all phosphorylation sites but retained a previously suggested LIP5-binding site. CD-spectroscopy indicated that wild-type AQP2 and the phospho-mimicking mutants had similar overall structure but displayed differences in melting temperatures possibly arising from C-terminal conformational changes. Non-phosphorylated AQP2 bound LIP5 with the highest affinity while AQP2-DeltaP242 had 20-fold lower affinity as determined by MST. AQP2-S256E, S261E, T269E and S256E/T269E all had reduced affinity. This effect was most prominent for AQP2-S256E, which fits well with its role in apical membrane targeting. AQP2-S264E had affinity similar to non-phoshorylated AQP2, possibly indicating a role in exosome excretion. Our data suggest that AQP2 phosphorylation allosterically controls its interaction with LIP5, illustrating how altered affinities to interacting proteins forms the basis for regulation of AQP2 trafficking by post-translational modifications.},

abstract = {Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domains are essential modules of many multi-domain signalling proteins that mediate protein interaction and/or sense environmental stimuli. Frequently, multiple PAS domains are present within single polypeptide chains, where their interplay is required for protein function. Although many isolated PAS domain structures have been reported over the last decades, only a few structures of multi-PAS proteins are known. Therefore, the molecular mechanism of multi-PAS domain-mediated protein oligomerization and function is poorly understood. The transcription factor PpsR from Rhodobacter sphaeroides is such a multi-PAS domain protein that, in addition to its three PAS domains, contains a glutamine-rich linker and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. Here, crystal structures of two N-terminally and C-terminally truncated PpsR variants that comprise a single (PpsRQ-PAS1) and two (PpsRN-Q-PAS1) PAS domains, respectively, are presented and the multi-step strategy required for the phasing of a triple PAS domain construct (PpsR$\Delta$HTH) is illustrated. While parts of the biologically relevant dimerization interface can already be observed in the two shorter constructs, the PpsR$\Delta$HTH structure reveals how three PAS domains enable the formation of multiple oligomeric states (dimer, tetramer and octamer), highlighting that not only the PAS cores but also their $\alpha$-helical extensions are essential for protein oligomerization. The results demonstrate that the long helical glutamine-rich linker of PpsR results from a direct fusion of the N-cap of the PAS1 domain with the C-terminal extension of the N-domain that plays an important role in signal transduction.},

abstract = {The first-known aptamer for the stress biomarker cortisol was selected using a tunable stringency magnetic bead selection strategy. The capture DNA probe immobilized on the beads was systematically lengthened to increase the number of bases bound to the complementary pool primer regions following selection enrichment. This resulted in a single sequence (15-1) dominating the final round 15 pool, where the same sequence was the second-highest copy number candidate in the enriched pool with the shorter capture DNA probe (round 13). A thorough analysis of the next-generation sequencing results showed that a high copy number may only correlate with enhanced affinity under certain stringency and enrichment conditions, in contrast with prior published reports. Aptamer 15-1 demonstrated enhanced binding to cortisol (K d = 6.9 ± 2.8 $\mu$M by equilibrium dialysis; 16.1 ± 0.6 $\mu$M by microscale thermophoresis) when compared with the top sequence from round 13 and the negative control progesterone. Whereas most aptamer selections terminate at the selection round demonstrating the highest enrichment, this work shows that extending the selection with higher stringency conditions leads to lower amounts eluted by the target but higher copy numbers of a sequence with enhanced binding. The structure-switching aptamer was applied to a gold nanoparticle assay in buffer and was shown to discriminate between cortisol and two other stress biomarkers, norepinephrine and epinephrine, and a structurally analogous biomarker of liver dysfunction, cholic acid. We believe this approach enhances aptamer selection and serves as proof-of-principle work toward development of point-of-care diagnostics for medical, combat, or bioterrorism targets.},

As an example, we measured the affinity of a small molecule inhibitor to His-tagged p38$\alpha$ kinase expressed in mammalian cells.

We show that DJ-1 physically binds the 20S proteasome and inhibits its activity, rescuing partially unfolded proteins from degradation. Consequently, DJ-1 stabilizes the cellular levels of 20S proteasome substrates, as we show for alpha-synuclein and p53. Furthermore, we demonstrate that following oxidative stress, DJ-1 is involved in the Nrf2-dependent oxidative stress response that leads to the upregulation of both the 20S proteasome and its regulator, NQO1. Overall, our results suggest a regulatory circuit in which DJ-1, under conditions of oxidative stress, both upregulates and inhibits the 20S proteasome, providing a rigorous control mechanism at a time when the 20S proteasome becomes the major proteolytic machinery. Such a tight regulation of the 20S proteasome may sustain the balance between the need to rapidly eliminate oxidatively damaged proteins and maintain the abundance of native, intrinsically unstructured proteins, which coordinate regulatory and signalling events.},

By monitoring the thermophoretic behavior of ATTO488-labeled actin in a temperature gradient over time, we could follow polymerization in real time and resolve its three characteristic phases: nucleation, elongation, and steady-state equilibration. Titration experiments allowed us to evaluate the effects of actin-binding proteins (ABPs) on polymerization, including DNase I-induced inhibition and mDia2FH1FH2 (mDia2)-assisted acceleration of nucleation. The corresponding rates of actin filament elongation were quantitatively determined, yielding values in good agreement with those obtained using the pyrene-actin polymerization assay. Finally, we measured the effect of myosin on actin polymerization, circumventing the problems of fluorescence quenching and signal disturbance that occur with other techniques. MST is a simple and valuable research tool for investigating actin kinetics covering a wide range of molecular interactions, with low protein consumption.},

To characterize the MUC4-ErbB2 interaction, we used MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST), a powerful method for quantitative protein interaction analysis under challenging conditions. We worked with CHO cell lysates containing either the transmembrane $\beta$ subunit of MUC4 (MUC4$\beta$) or a truncated mutant encompassing only the EGF domains (MUC4EGF3+1+2). MST studies have led to the characterization of equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for MUC4$\beta$-ErbB2 (7–25 nM) and MUC4EGF3+1+2/ErbB2 (65–79 nM) complexes. This work provides new information regarding the MUC4-ErbB2 interaction at the biophysical level and also confirms that the presence of the three EGF domains of MUC4 is sufficient to provide efficient interaction. This technological approach will be very useful in the future to validate small molecule binding affinities targeting MUC4-ErbB2 complex for drug discovery development in cancer. It will also be of high interest for the other known membrane mucins forming oncogenic complexes with ErbBs at the cancer cell surface.},

abstract = {The DEAD-box protein UAP56 (U2AF65-associcated protein) is an RNA helicase that in yeast and metazoa is critically involved in mRNA splicing and export. In Arabidopsis, two adjacent genes code for an identical UAP56 protein, and both genes are expressed. In case one of the genes is inactivated by a T-DNA insertion, wild type transcript level is maintained by the other intact gene. In contrast to other organisms that are severely affected by elevated UAP56 levels, Arabidopsis plants that overexpress UAP56 have wild type appearance. UAP56 localises predominantly to euchromatic regions of Arabidopsis nuclei, and associates with genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II independently from the presence of introns, while it is not detected at non-transcribed loci. Biochemical characterisation revealed that in addition to ssRNA and dsRNA, UAP56 interacts with dsDNA, but not with ssDNA. Moreover, the enzyme displays ATPase activity that is stimulated by RNA and dsDNA and it has ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity unwinding dsRNA, whereas it does not unwind dsDNA. Protein interaction studies showed that UAP56 directly interacts with the mRNA export factors ALY2 and MOS11, suggesting that it is involved in mRNA export from plant cell nuclei.},

abstract = {Lysosomes respond to environmental cues by controlling their own biogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we describe a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent and mTORC1-independent mechanism for regulating lysosome biogenesis, which provides insights into previously reported effects of PKC on lysosomes. By identifying lysosome-inducing compounds we show that PKC couples activation of the TFEB transcription factor with inactivation of the ZKSCAN3 transcriptional repressor through two parallel signalling cascades. Activated PKC inactivates GSK3beta, leading to reduced phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and activation of TFEB, while PKC activates JNK and p38 MAPK, which phosphorylate ZKSCAN3, leading to its inactivation by translocation out of the nucleus. PKC activation may therefore mediate lysosomal adaptation to many extracellular cues. PKC activators facilitate clearance of aggregated proteins and lipid droplets in cell models and ameliorate amyloid beta plaque formation in APP/PS1 mouse brains. Thus, PKC activators are viable treatment options for lysosome-related disorders.},

abstract = {TRPM8 is a member of the transient receptor potential ion channel family where it functions as a cold and pain sensor in humans and other higher organisms. Previous studies show that TRPM8 requires the signaling phosphoinositide lipid PIP2 to function. TRPM8 function is further regulated by other diverse mechanisms, including the small modulatory membrane protein PIRT (phosphoinositide regulator of TRP). Like TRPM8, PIRT also binds PIP2 and behavioral studies have shown that PIRT is required for normal TRPM8-mediated cold-sensing. To better understand the molecular mechanism of PIRT regulation of TRPM8, solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to assign the backbone resonances of full-length human PIRT and investigate the direct binding of PIRT to PIP2 and the human TRPM8 S1-S4 transmembrane domain. Microscale thermophoresis (MST) binding studies validate the NMR results and identify a competitive PIRT interaction between PIP2 and the TRPM8 S1-S4 domain. Computational PIP2 docking to a human TRPM8 comparative model was performed to help localize where PIRT may bind TRPM8. Taken together, our data suggest a mechanism where TRPM8, PIRT, and PIP2 form a regulatory complex and PIRT modulation of TRPM8 arises, at least in part, by regulating local concentrations of PIP2 accessible to TRPM8.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance resulting in ineffective treatment of infectious diseases is an increasing global problem, particularly in infections with pathogenic bacteria. In some bacteria, such as Streptococcus pyogenes, the pathogenicity is strongly linked to the attachment of virulence factors. Their attachment to the cellular membrane is a transpeptidation reaction, catalyzed by sortase enzymes. As such, sortases pose an interesting target for the development of new antivirulence strategies that could yield novel antimicrobial drugs. Using the substitution-oriented fragment screening (SOS) approach, we discovered a potent and specific inhibitor (C10) of sortase A from S. pyogenes. The inhibitor C10 showed high specificity towards S. pyogenes sortase A, with an IC50 value of 10 $\mu$M and a Kd of 60 $\mu$M. We envision that this inhibitor could be employed as a starting point for further exploration of sortase's potential as therapeutic target for antimicrobial drug development.},

ML364, and not the inactive analog 2, was antiproliferative in cancer cell lines.

abstract = {The goal of this study was to determine whether the guluronate (G) rich alginate OligoG CF-5/20 (OligoG) could detach cystic fibrosis (CF) mucus by calcium chelation, which is also required for normal mucin unfolding. Since bicarbonate secretion is impaired in CF, leading to insufficient mucin unfolding and thereby attached mucus and since bicarbonate has the ability to bind calcium, we hypothesized that the calcium chelating property of OligoG would lead to detachment of CF mucus. Indeed, OligoG could compete with the N-terminus of the MUC2 mucin for calcium binding as shown by microscale thermophoresis. Further, effects on mucus thickness and attachment induced by OligoG and other alginate fractions of different length and composition were evaluated in explants of CF mouse ileum mounted in horizontal Ussing-type chambers. OligoG at 1.5{\%} caused effective detachment of CF mucus and the most potent alginate fraction tested, the poly-G fraction of about 12 residues, had similar potency compared to OligoG whereas mannuronate-rich (M) polymers had minimal effect. In conclusion, OligoG binds calcium with appropriate affinity without any overt harmful effect on the tissue and can be exploited for treating mucus stagnation.

The cryo-EM 3D reconstruction revealed a globular architecture of the Tim-Tipin-RPA complex with a ring-like and a U-shaped domain covered by a RPA lid. Interestingly, RPA in the complex adopts a horse shoe-like shape resembling its conformation in the presence of long ssDNA ({\textgreater}30 nucleotides).

abstract = {Nonstructural protein 15 (Nsp15) encoded by coronavirus (CoV) is a nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) that plays an essential role in the life cycle of the virus. Structural information on this crucial protein from the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), which is lethally pathogenic and has caused severe respiratory diseases worldwide, is lacking. Here, we determined the crystal structure of MERS-CoV Nsp15 at a 2.7-{\AA} resolution and performed the relevant biochemical assays to study how NendoU activity is regulated. Although the overall structure is conserved, MERS-CoV Nsp15 shows unique and novel features compared to its homologs. Serine substitution of residue F285, which harbors an aromatic side chain that disturbs RNA binding compared with that of other homologs, increases catalytic activity. Mutations of residues residing on the oligomerization interfaces that distort hexamerization, namely, N38A, Y58A, and N157A, decrease thermostability, decrease affinity of binding with RNA, and reduce the NendoU activity of Nsp15. In contrast, mutant D39A exhibits increased activity and a higher substrate binding capacity. Importantly, Nsp8 was found to interact with both monomeric and hexameric Nsp15. The Nsp7/Nsp8 complex displays a higher binding affinity for Nsp15. Furthermore, Nsp8 and the Nsp7/Nsp8 complex also enhance the NendoU activity of hexameric Nsp15 in vitro . Taking the findings together, this work first provides evidence on how the activity of Nsp15 may be functionally mediated by catalytic residues, oligomeric assembly, RNA binding efficiency, or the possible association with other nonstructural proteins. IMPORTANCE The lethally pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) pose serious threats to humans. Endoribonuclease Nsp15 encoded by coronavirus plays an important role in viral infection and pathogenesis. This study determines the structure of MERS-CoV Nsp15 and demonstrates how the catalytic activity of this protein is potentially mediated, thereby providing structural and functional evidence for developing antiviral drugs. We also hypothesize that the primase-like protein Nsp8 and the Nsp7/Nsp8 complex may interact with Nsp15 and affect enzymatic activity. This contributes to the understanding of the association of Nsp15 with the viral replication and transcription machinery.},

abstract = {The RNA exosome complex associates with nuclear and cytoplasmic cofactors to mediate the decay, surveillance, or processing of a wide variety of transcripts. In the cytoplasm, the conserved core of the exosome (Exo10) functions together with the??conserved Ski complex. The interaction of S.??cerevisiae Exo10 and Ski is not direct but requires a bridging cofactor, Ski7. Here, we report the 2.65???? resolution structure of S.??cerevisiae Exo10 bound to the interacting domain of Ski7. Extensive hydrophobic interactions rationalize the high affinity and stability of this complex, pointing to Ski7 as a constitutive component of the cytosolic exosome. Despite the absence of sequence homology, cytoplasmic Ski7 and nuclear Rrp6 bind Exo10 using similar surfaces and recognition motifs. Knowledge of the interacting residues in the yeast complexes allowed us to identify a splice variant of human HBS1-Like as a Ski7-like exosome-binding protein, revealing the evolutionary conservation of this cytoplasmic cofactor.},

abstract = {A new antimicrobial peptide l-RW containing double amphipathic binding sequences was designed, and its biological activities were investigated in the present study. L-RW showed antibacterial activity against several bacterial strains but low cytotoxicity to mammalian cells and low hemolytic activity to red blood cells, which makes it a potential and promising peptide for further development. Microscale thermophoresis (MST), a new technique, was applied to study the antimicrobial peptide–lipid interaction for the first time, which examined the binding affinities of this new antimicrobial peptide to various lipids, including different phospholipids, mixture lipids and bacterial lipid extracts. The results demonstrated that l-RW bound preferentially to negatively charged lipids over neutral lipids, which was consistent with the biological activities, revealing the important role of electrostatic interaction in the binding process. L-RW also showed higher binding affinity for lipid extract from Staphyloccocus aureus compared with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, which were in good agreement with the higher antibacterial activity against S. aureus than P. aeruginosa and E. coli, suggesting that the binding affinity is capable to predict the antibacterial activity to some extent. Additionally, the binding of l-RW to phospholipids was also performed in fetal bovine serum solution by MST, which revealed that the components in biological solution may have interference with the binding event. The results proved that MST is a useful and potent tool in antimicrobial peptide–lipid interaction investigation.

Despite recent developments there is still an urgent need for ultra-small high-affinity intein tags for in vitro and in vivo approaches. To date, only very few in-cell applications of protein trans-splicing have been reported, all limited to C-terminal protein modifications. Here, we developed a strategy for covalent N-terminal intein-mediated protein labeling at (sub) nanomolar probe concentrations. Combined with a minimal synthetic lock-and-key element, the affinity between the intein fragments was increased to 10 nM. Site-specific and efficient 'traceless' protein modification by high-affinity trans-splicing is demonstrated at nanomolar concentrations in living mammalian cells.},

abstract = {Protein:protein interactions are fundamental in living organism homeostasis. Here we introduce VHH6, a junctional epitope antibody capable of specifically recognizing a neo-epitope when two proteins interact, albeit transiently, to form a complex. Orthogonal biophysical techniques have been used to prove the "junctional epitope" nature of VHH6, a camelid single domain antibody recognizing the IL-6-gp80 complex but not the individual components alone. X-ray crystallography, HDX-MS and SPR analysis confirmed that the CDR regions of VHH6 interact simultaneously with IL-6 and gp80, locking the two proteins together. At the cellular level, VHH6 was able to alter the response of endothelial cells to exogenous IL-6, promoting a sustained STAT3 phosphorylation signal, an accumulation of IL-6 in vesicles and an overall pro-inflammatory phenotype supported further by transcriptomic analysis. Junctional epitope antibodies, like VHH6, not only offer new opportunities in screening and structure-aided drug discovery, but could also be exploited as therapeutics to modulate complex protein:protein interactions.},

abstract = {The 14-3-3 proteins, a family of highly conserved scaffolding proteins ubiquitously expressed in all eukaryotic cells, interact with and regulate the function of several hundreds of partner proteins. Yeast neutral trehalases (Nth), enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of trehalose to glucose, compared with trehalases from other organisms, possess distinct structure and regulation involving phosphorylation at multiple sites followed by binding to the 14-3-3 protein. Here we report the crystal structures of yeast Nth1 and its complex with Bmh1 (yeast 14-3-3 isoform), which, together with mutational and fluorescence studies, indicate that the binding of Nth1 by 14-3- 3 triggers Nth1's activity by enabling the proper 3D configuration of Nth1's catalytic and calcium-binding domains relative to each other, thus stabilizing the flexible part of the active site required for catalysis. The presented structure of the Bmh1:Nth1 complex highlights the ability of 14-3-3 to modulate the structure of a multidomain binding partner and to function as an allosteric effector. Furthermore, comparison of the Bmh1:Nth1 complex structure with those of 14-3-3:serotonin N-acetyltransferase and 14-3-3:heat shock protein beta-6 complexes revealed similarities in the 3D structures of bound partner proteins, suggesting the highly conserved nature of 14-3-3 affects the structures of many client proteins.},

abstract = {The hypoxia-inducible factor complex (HIF-$\alpha${\textperiodcentered}aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)) requires association with several transcription coactivators for a successful cellular response to hypoxic stress. In addition to the conventional global transcription coactivator CREB-binding protein/p300 (CBP/p300) that binds to the HIF-$\alpha$ transactivation domain, a new group of transcription coactivators called the coiled-coil coactivators (CCCs) interact directly with the second PER-ARNT-SIM (PAS) domain of ARNT (ARNT PAS-B). These less studied transcription coactivators play essential roles in the HIF-dependent hypoxia response, and CCC misregulation is associated with several forms of cancer. To better understand CCC protein recruitment by the heterodimeric HIF transcription factor, we used x-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and biochemical methods to investigate the structure of the ARNT PAS-B domain in complex with the C-terminal fragment of a coiled-coil coactivator protein, transforming acidic coiled-coil coactivator 3 (TACC3). We found that the HIF-2$\alpha$ PAS-B domain also directly interacts with TACC3, motivating an NMR data-derived model suggesting a means by which TACC3 could form a ternary complex with HIF-2$\alpha$ PAS-B and ARNT PAS-B via $\beta$-sheet/coiled-coil interactions. These findings suggest that TACC3 could be recruited as a bridge to cooperatively mediate between the HIF-2$\alpha$ PAS-B{\textperiodcentered}ARNT PAS-B complex, thereby participating more directly in HIF-dependent gene transcription than previously anticipated.},

Phylogenetic analysis indicates that calsequestrin is an ancient gene in metazoans, and that the duplication of the ancestral calsequestrin gene took place after the emergence of the lancelet. CASQ2 gene variants associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) in humans are positively correlated with a high degree of evolutionary conservation across all calsequestrin homologues.

Importantly, this "background" level of receptor phosphorylation is insufficient to effect a downstream response, suggesting that strict controls are present and prohibit full activation. Here a mechanism is described in which control of FGFR2 activation is provided by the adaptor protein Grb2. Dimeric Grb2 binds to the C termini of two FGFR2 molecules. This heterotetramer is capable of a low-level receptor transphosphorylation, but C-terminal phosphorylation and recruitment of signaling proteins are sterically hindered. Upon stimulation, FGFR2 phosphorylates tyrosine residues on Grb2, promoting dissociation from the receptor and allowing full activation of downstream signaling. These observations establish a role for Grb2 as an active regulator of RTK signaling.},

Using targeted proteomics, we identified proteins that associate with the THO core complex of Arabidopsis TREX. In addition to the RNA helicase UAP56 and the mRNA export factors ALY2-4 and MOS11 we detected interactions with the mRNA export complex TREX-2 and multiple spliceosomal components. Plants defective in the THO component TEX1 or in the mRNA export factor MOS11 (orthologue of human CIP29) are mildly affected. However, tex1 mos11 double-mutant plants show marked defects in vegetative and reproductive development. In tex1 plants, the levels of tasiRNAs are reduced, while miR173 levels are decreased in mos11 mutants. In nuclei of mos11 cells increased mRNA accumulation was observed, while no mRNA export defect was detected with tex1 cells. Nevertheless, in tex1 mos11 double-mutants, the mRNA export defect was clearly enhanced relative to mos11. The subnuclear distribution of TEX1 substantially overlaps with that of splicingrelated SR proteins and in tex1 plants the ratio of certain alternative splicing events is altered.

abstract = {Interleukin-1?? (IL-1??) is a key orchestrator in inflammatory and several immune responses. IL-1?? exerts its effects through interleukin-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI) and interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), which together form a heterotrimeric signaling-competent complex. Canakinumab and gevokizumab are highly specific IL-1?? monoclonal antibodies. Canakinumab is known to neutralize IL-1?? by competing for binding to IL-1R and therefore blocking signaling by the antigen:antibody complex. Gevokizumab is claimed to be a regulatory therapeutic antibody that modulates IL-1?? bioactivity by reducing the affinity for its IL-1RI:IL-1RAcP signaling complex. How IL-1?? signaling is affected by both canakinumab and gevokizumab was not yet experimentally determined. We have analyzed the crystal structures of canakinumab and gevokizumab antibody binding fragment (Fab) as well as of their binary complexes with IL-1??. Furthermore, we characterized the epitopes on IL-1?? employed by the antibodies by NMR epitope mapping studies. The direct comparison of NMR and X-ray data shows that the epitope defined by the crystal structure encompasses predominantly those residues whose NMR resonances are severely perturbed upon complex formation. The antigen:Fab co-structures confirm the previously identified key contact residues on IL-1?? and provide insight into the mechanisms leading to their distinct modulation of IL-1?? signaling. A significant steric overlap of the binding interfaces of IL-1R and canakinumab on IL-1?? causes competitive inhibition of the association of IL-1?? and its receptor. In contrast, gevokizumab occupies an allosteric site on IL-1?? and complex formation results in a minor reduction of binding affinity to IL-1RI. This suggests two different mechanisms of IL-1?? pathway attenuation. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have emerged as important and challenging targets in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry. The main difficulty encountered in the discovery of small molecule modulators derives from the large contact surfaces involved in PPIs when compared with those that participate in protein-small molecule interactions. Because of their intrinsic features, peptides can explore larger surfaces and therefore represent a useful alternative to modulate PPIs. The use of peptides as therapeutics has been held back by their instability in vivo and poor cell internalization. However, more than 200 peptide drugs and homologous compounds (proteins or antibodies) containing peptide bonds are (or have been) on the market, and many alternatives are now available to tackle these limitations. This review will focus on the latest progress in the field, spanning from "lead" identification methods to binding evaluation techniques, through an update of the most successful examples described in the literature.},

abstract = {Saposin-derived lipid nanoparticles (SapNPs) are a new alternative tool for membrane protein reconstitution. Here we demonstrate the potential and advantages of SapNPs. We show that SapA has the lowest lipid specificity for SapNP formation. These nanoparticles are modular and offer a tunable range of size and composition depending on the stoichiometric ratio of lipid and saposin components. They are stable and exhibit features typical of lipid-bilayer systems. Our data suggest that SapNPs are versatile and can adapt to membrane proteins of various sizes and architectures. Using SapA and various types of lipids we could reconstitute membrane proteins of different transmembrane cross-sectional areas (from 14 to 56 transmembrane $\alpha$ helices). SapNP-reconstituted proteins bound their respective ligands and were more heat stable compared with the detergent-solubilized form. Moreover, SapNPs encircle membrane proteins in a compact way, allowing structural investigations of small membrane proteins in a detergent-free environment using small-angle X-ray scattering. Saposin-derived lipid nanoparticles (SapNPs) are an alternative tool for membrane protein (MP) reconstitution. Flayhan et al. characterize these nanoparticles, showing that they are versatile and can adapt to MPs of various sizes and architectures. SapNP-reconstituted MPs can be treated as soluble proteins and used for structural and functional studies.},

abstract = {Summary While recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) has been widely used to treat anemia in cancer patients, concerns about its adverse effects on patient survival have emerged. A lack of correlation between expression of the canonical EpoR and rhEpo's effects on cancer cells prompted us to consider the existence of an alternative Epo receptor. Here, we identified EphB4 as an Epo receptor that triggers downstream signaling via STAT3 and promotes rhEpo-induced tumor growth and progression. In human ovarian and breast cancer samples, expression of EphB4 rather than the canonical EpoR correlated with decreased disease-specific survival in rhEpo-treated patients. These results identify EphB4 as a critical mediator of erythropoietin-induced tumor progression and further provide clinically significant dimension to the biology of erythropoietin.},

We demonstrate that the multicomponent reaction‐based stapling is an effective strategy for the development of $\alpha$‐helical peptides with highly potent dual antagonistic action of MDM2 and MDMX binding p53. Such a potent inhibitory activity of p53‐MDM2/X interactions was assessed by fluorescence polarization, microscale thermophoresis and 2D NMR, while several cocrystal structures with MDM2 were obtained. This MCR stapling protocol proved efficient and versatile in terms of diversity generation at the staple, as evidenced by the incorporation of both exo ‐ and endo ‐cyclic hydrophobic moieties at the side chain cross‐linkers. The interaction of the Ugi‐staple fragments with the target protein was demonstrated by crystallography, while the difference in ring sizes, flexibility and number of amide bonds within the ring seem to be crucial for a potent activity.},

However, in most plant species members of this family have evolved to transport nitrate as well as additional secondary metabolites and hormones. In response to falling nitrate levels, NRT1.1 is phosphorylated on an intracellular threonine that switches the transporter from a low-affinity to high-affinity state. Here we present both the apo and nitrate-bound crystal structures of Arabidopsis thaliana NRT1.1, which together with in vitro binding and transport data identify a key role for His[thinsp]356 in nitrate binding. Our data support a model whereby phosphorylation increases structural flexibility and in turn the rate of transport. Comparison with peptide transporters further reveals how the NRT1/PTR family has evolved to recognize diverse nitrogenous ligands, while maintaining elements of a conserved coupling mechanism within this superfamily of nutrient transporters.},

abstract = {Oncogenic mutations of the Wnt (wingless)/beta-catenin pathway are frequently observed in major cancer types. Thus far, however, no therapeutic agent targeting Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is available for clinical use. Here we demonstrate that axitinib, a clinically approved drug, strikingly blocks Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in cancer cells, zebrafish, and Apc(min/+) mice. Notably, axitinib dramatically induces Wnt asymmetry and nonrandom DNA segregation in cancer cells by promoting nuclear beta-catenin degradation independent of the GSK3beta (glycogen synthase kinase3beta)/APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) complex. Using a DARTS (drug affinity-responsive target stability) assay coupled to 2D-DIGE (2D difference in gel electrophoresis) and mass spectrometry, we have identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase SHPRH (SNF2, histone-linker, PHD and RING finger domain-containing helicase) as the direct target of axitinib in blocking Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Treatment with axitinib stabilizes SHPRH and thereby increases the ubiquitination and degradation of beta-catenin. Our findings suggest a previously unreported mechanism of nuclear beta-catenin regulation and indicate that axitinib, a clinically approved drug, would provide therapeutic benefits for cancer patients with aberrant nuclear beta-catenin activation.},

These probes penetrated more easily into samples and detected their targets more efficiently than conventional antibodies in crowded regions. When investigated by super-resolution imaging, the nanobodies revealed substantial extra-synaptic populations for both SNAP-25 and Syntaxin 1A, which were poorly detected by antibodies. Moreover, extra-synaptic Syntaxin 1A molecules were recruited to synapses during stimulation, suggesting that these are physiologically-active molecules. We conclude that nanobodies are able to reveal qualitatively and quantitatively different organization patterns, when compared to conventional antibodies.},

abstract = {Abstract Amyloid $\beta$-peptides (A$\beta$) play a major role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, numerous monoclonal antibodies against A$\beta$ have been developed for basic and clinical research. The present study applied fluorescence based analytical ultracentrifugation and microscale thermophoresis to characterize the interaction between A$\beta$42 monomers and three popular, commercially available antibodies, namely 6E10, 4G8 and 12F4. Both methods allowed us to analyze the interactions at low nanomolar concentrations of analytes close to their dissociation constants (KD) as required for the study of high affinity interactions. Furthermore, the low concentrations minimized the unwanted self-aggregation of A$\beta$. Our study demonstrates that all three antibodies bind to A$\beta$42 monomers with comparable affinities in the low nanomolar range. KD values for A$\beta$42 binding to 6E10 and 4G8 are in good agreement with formerly reported values from SPR studies, while the KD for 12F4 binding to A$\beta$42 monomer is reported for the first time.},

abstract = {The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an essential cell signaling system that detects the accumulation of misfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and initiates a cellular response in order to maintain homeostasis. How cells detect the accumulation of misfolded proteins remains unclear. In this study, we identify a noncanonical interaction between the ATPase domain of the ER chaperone BiP and the luminal domains of the UPR sensors Ire1 and Perk that dissociates when authentic ER unfolded protein CH1 binds to the canonical substrate binding domain of BiP. Unlike the interaction between chaperone and substrates, we found that the interaction between BiP and UPR sensors was unaffected by nucleotides. Thus, we discover that BiP is dual functional UPR sensor, sensing unfolded proteins by canonical binding to substrates and transducing this event to noncanonical, signaling interaction to Ire1 and Perk. Our observations implicate BiP as the key component for detecting ER stress and suggest an allosteric mechanism for UPR induction.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03522.001Author keywordsResearch organism},

abstract = {A key function of reversible protein phosphorylation is to regulate protein-protein interactions, many of which involve short linear motifs (3-12 amino acids). Motif-based interactions are difficult to capture because of their often low-to-moderate affinities. Here, we describe phosphomimetic proteomic peptide-phage display, a powerful method for simultaneously finding motif-based interaction and pinpointing phosphorylation switches. We compu-tationally designed an oligonucleotide library encoding human C-terminal peptides containing known or predicted Ser/Thr phos-phosites and phosphomimetic variants thereof. We incorporated these oligonucleotides into a phage library and screened the PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) domains of Scribble and DLG1 for interactions potentially enabled or disabled by ligand phosphorylation. We identified known and novel binders and characterized selected interactions through microscale thermophoresis, isothermal titra-tion calorimetry, and NMR. We uncover site-specific phospho-regulation of PDZ domain interactions, provide a structural framework for how PDZ domains accomplish phosphopeptide binding, and discuss ligand phosphorylation as a switching mechanism of PDZ domain interactions. The approach is readily scalable and can be used to explore the potential phospho-regulation of motif-based interactions on a large scale.},

abstract = {The SecY/61 complex forms the protein-channel component of the ubiquitous protein secretion and membrane protein insertion apparatus. The bacterial version SecYEG interacts with the highly conserved YidC and SecDF–YajC subcomplex, which facilitates translocation into and across the membrane. Together, they form the holo-translocon (HTL), which we have successfully overexpressed and purified. In contrast to the homo-dimeric SecYEG, the HTL is a hetero-dimer composed of single copies of SecYEG and SecDF–YajC–YidC. The activities of the HTL differ from the archetypal SecYEG complex. It is more effective in cotranslational insertion of membrane proteins and the posttranslational secretion of a $\beta$-barreled outer-membrane protein driven by SecA and ATP becomes much more dependent on the proton-motive force. The activity of the translocating copy of SecYEG may therefore be modulated by association with different accessory subcomplexes: SecYEG (forming SecYEG dimers) or SecDF–YajC–YidC (forming the HTL). This versatility may provide a means to refine the secretion and insertion capabilities according to the substrate. A similar modularity may also be exploited for the translocation or insertion of a wide range of substrates across and into the endoplasmic reticular and mitochondrial membranes of eukaryotes.},

abstract = {Background: The structure of human galectin-16 (Gal-16) has yet to be solved, and its function has remained elusive. Methods: X-ray crystallography was used to determine the atomic structures of Gal-16 and two of its mutants. The Gal-16 oligomer state was investigated by gel filtration, its hemagglutination activity was determined along with its ability to bind lactose using ITC. The cellular distribution of EGFP-tagged Gal-16 in various cell lines was also investigated, and the interaction between Gal-16 and c-Rel was assessed by pull-down studies, microscale thermophoresis and immunofluorescence. Results: Unlike other galectins, Gal-16 lacks the ability to bind the $\beta$-galactoside lactose. Lactose binding could be regained by replacing an arginine (Arg55) with asparagine, as shown in the crystal structures of two lactoseloaded Gal-16 mutants (R55N and R55N/H57R). Gal-16 was also shown to be monomeric by gel filtration, as well as in crystal structures. Thus, this galectin could not induce erythrocyte agglutination. EGFP-tagged Gal-16 was found to be localized mostly in the nucleus of various cell types, and can interact with c-Rel, a member of NF-$\kappa$B family. Conclusions: Gal-16 exists as a monomer and its ligand binding is significantly different from that of other prototype galectins, suggesting that it has a novel function(s). The interaction between Gal-16 and c-Rel indicates that Gal-16 may regulate signal transduction pathways via the c-Rel hub in B or T cells at the maternalfetal interface. General significance: The present study lays the foundation for further studies into the cellular and physiological functions of Gal-16.},

We study two novel marine-organism TALE-like proteins (MOrTL1 and MOrTL2), the first to date of non-terrestrial origin. We have assessed their DNA-binding properties and modelled repeat structures. We found that repeats from these proteins mediate sequence specific DNA binding conforming to the TALE code, despite low sequence similarity to TALE repeats, and with novel residues around the BSR. However, MOrTL1 repeats show greater sequence discriminating power than MOrTL2 repeats. Sequence alignments show that there are only three residues conserved between repeats of all TALE-like proteins including the two new additions. This conserved motif could prove useful as an identifier for future TALE-likes. Additionally, comparing MOrTL repeats with those of other TALE-likes suggests a common evolutionary origin for the TALEs, RipTALs and Bats.},

In Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli, this step implies the invagination of three biological layers (cytoplasmic membrane, peptidoglycan and outer membrane), biosynthesis of the new poles and eventually, daughter cells separation. The latter requires the coordinated action of the N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine amidases AmiA/B/C and their LytM activators EnvC and NlpD to cleave the septal peptidoglycan. We present here the 2.5 A crystal structure of AmiC which includes the first report of an AMIN domain structure, a beta-sandwich of two symmetrical four-stranded beta-sheets exposing highly conserved motifs on the two outer faces. We show that this N-terminal domain, involved in the localization of AmiC at the division site, is a new peptidoglycan-binding domain. The C-terminal catalytic domain shows an auto-inhibitory alpha helix obstructing the active site. AmiC lacking this helix exhibits by itself an activity comparable to that of the wild type AmiC activated by NlpD. We also demonstrate the interaction between AmiC and NlpD by microscale thermophoresis and confirm the importance of the active site blocking alpha helix in the regulation of the amidase activity.},

Microtubule polymers disrupted this interaction. In cells, MPS1 binding to kinetochores or to ectopic NDC80 complexes was prevented by end-on microtubule attachment, independent of known kinetochore protein-removal mechanisms. Competition for kinetochore binding between SAC proteins and microtubules provides a direct and perhaps evolutionarily conserved way to detect a properly organized spindle ready for cell division.},

abstract = {The structural transition and misfolding of human islet amyloid polypeptide may cause a common metabolic disease Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Seventeen peptides have been synthesized, possessing different lengths, compositions, and peptide conformation. In this study, the mechanism of these peptides on inhibiting the formation of hIAPP11–20 amyloid fibrils was investigated using a conventional ThT fluorescence assay and microscale thermophoresis. The results showed that short peptides AT, SA, RF, KS, KT and KN, and cyclic peptides cyclic-KS, cyclic-KT and cyclic-KN displayed considerable inhibitory effect on hIAPP11–20 fibril formation and a strong affinity for hIAPP11–20. The detailed investigation indicated that the phenylalanine residue and some special peptide composition significantly inhibit amyloid formation. The peptide conformation of the designed peptide inhibitors may also play an important role. Microscale thermophoresis quantified the binding affinities between hIAPP11–20 and the peptides; and revealed that high affinity binding more likely leads to inhibiting fibril formation of hIAPP11–20 and vice versa, which is in accordance with the results from the ThT assays. These findings suggest a feasible model of peptide inhibitor design for inhibiting amyloid formation. In addition, microscale thermophoresis was proven as a promising rapid method for preliminarily screening inhibitors of hIAPP11–20.},

abstract = {RNase P is a universal enzyme that removes 5' leader sequences from tRNA precursors. The enzyme is therefore essential for maturation of functional tRNAs and mRNA translation. RNase P represents a unique example of an enzyme that can occur either as ribonucleoprotein or as protein alone. The latter form of the enzyme, called protein-only RNase P (PRORP), is widespread in eukaryotes in which it can provide organellar or nuclear RNase P activities. Here, we have focused on Arabidopsis nuclear PRORP2 and its interaction with tRNA substrates. Affinity measurements helped assess the respective importance of individual pentatricopeptide repeat motifs in PRORP2 for RNA binding. We characterized the PRORP2 structure by X-ray crystallography and by small-angle X-ray scattering in solution as well as that of its complex with a tRNA precursor by small-angle X-ray scattering. Of note, our study reports the first structural data of a PRORP-tRNA complex. Combined with complementary biochemical and biophysical analyses, our structural data suggest that PRORP2 undergoes conformational changes to accommodate its substrate. In particular, the catalytic domain and the RNA-binding domain can move around a central hinge. Altogether, this work provides a refined model of the PRORP-tRNA complex that illustrates how protein-only RNase P enzymes specifically bind tRNA and highlights the contribution of protein dynamics to achieve this specific interaction.},

Several point mutations of GCAP1 have been associated with impaired calcium sensitivity that eventually triggers progressive retinal degeneration. In this work, we demonstrate that the recombinant human protein presents a highly dynamic monomer-dimer equilibrium, whose dissociation constant is influenced by salt concentration and, more importantly, by protein binding to Ca2+ or Mg2+. Based on small-angle X-ray scattering data, protein-protein docking, and molecular dynamics simulations we propose two novel three-dimensional models of Ca2+-bound GCAP1 dimer. The different propensity of human GCAP1 to dimerize suggests structural differences induced by cation binding potentially involved in the regulation of retGC activity.},

The discovery of camelid antibodies in the 1990s has extended the useful range of antibodies into pH extremes, high temperature, and high salt conditions due to increased stability. However, determining the binding properties of these molecules prior to use under these conditions has not been widely employed because the most precise biophysical methods, surface plasmon resonance, and isothermal titration calorimetry, are not compatible with highly complex matrices. Here we demonstrate the use of microscale thermophoresis as a rapid, simple method to detect binding of a single-domain antibody in the presence of jet fuel/water mixes; a complex, harsh environment. This work provides key data to quantifying binding for the development of a sensor for detection of microbial growth in fuel.},

abstract = {The calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cell (CN/NFAT) signaling pathway plays a critical role in the immune response. Therefore, inhibition of the CN/NFAT pathway is an important target for inflammatory disease. The conserved PxIxIT and LxVP motifs of CN substrates and targeting proteins have been recognized. Based on the affinity ability and inhibitory effect of these docking sequences on CN, we designed a bioactive peptide (named pep3) against the CN/NFAT interaction, which has two binding sites derived from the RCAN1-PxIxIT motif and the NFATc1-LxVP motif. The shortest linker between the two binding sites in pep3 is derived from A238L, a physiological binding partner of CN. Microscale thermophoresis (MST) revealed that pep3 has two docking sites on CN. Pep3 also has the most potent inhibitory effect on CN. It is suggested that pep3 contains an NFATc1-LxVP-substrate recognition motif and RCAN1-PxIxIT-mediated anchoring to CN. Expression of this peptide significantly suppresses CN/NFAT signaling. Cell-permeable 11-arginine-modified pep3 (11R-pep3) blocks the NFAT downstream signaling pathway. Intranasal administration of the 11R-pep3 peptide inhibits airway inflammation in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma model. Our results suggest that pep3 is promising as an immunosuppressive agent and can be used in topical remedies.},

abstract = {Mucin 5B (MUC5B) has an essential role in mucociliary clearance that protects the pulmonary airways. Accordingly, knowledge of MUC5B structure and its interactions with itself and other proteins is critical to better understand airway mucus biology and improve the management of lung diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The role of an N-terminal multimerization domain in the supramolecular organization of MUC5B has been previously described, but less is known about its C-terminal dimerization domain. Here, using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analyses of recombinant disulfide-linked dimeric MUC5B dimerization domain we identified an asymmetric, elongated twisted structure, with a double globular base. We found that the dimerization domain is more resistant to disruption than the multimerization domain suggesting the twisted structure of the dimerization domain confers additional stability to MUC5B polymers. Size-exclusion chromatography-multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS), SPR-based biophysical analyses and microscale thermophoresis of the dimerization domain disclosed no further assembly, but did reveal reversible, calcium-dependent interactions between the dimerization and multimerization domains that were most active at acidic pH, suggesting that these domains have a role in MUC5B intragranular organization. In summary, our results suggest a role for the C-terminal dimerization domain of MUC5B in compaction of mucin chains during granular packaging via interactions with the N-terminal multimerization domain. Our findings further suggest that the less stable multimerization domain provides a potential target for mucin depolymerization to remove mucus plugs in COPD and other lung pathologies.},

The search for optimal combinations of biophysical techniques that can correctly and efficiently identify and quantify binding can be challenging due to the physicochemical properties of fragments. In order to minimize the time and costs of screening, optimal combinations of biophysical techniques with maximal information content, sensitivity, and robustness are needed. Here we describe an approach utilizing automated microscale thermophoresis (MST) affinity screening to identify fragments active against MEK1 kinase. MST identified multiple hits that were confirmed by X-ray crystallography but not detected by orthogonal methods. Furthermore, MST also provided information about ligand-induced aggregation and protein denaturation. The technique delivered a large number of binders while reducing experimentation time and sample consumption, demonstrating the potential of MST to execute and maximize the efficacy of fragment screening campaigns.},

abstract = {The spindle checkpoint of the cell division cycle senses kinetochores that are not attached to microtubules and prevents precocious onset of anaphase, which can lead to aneuploidy. The nuclear division cycle 80 complex (Ndc80C) is a major microtubule receptor at the kinetochore. Ndc80C also mediates the kinetochore recruitment of checkpoint proteins. We found that the checkpoint protein kinase monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1) directly bound to Ndc80C through two independent interactions. Both interactions involved the microtubule-binding surfaces of Ndc80C and were directly inhibited in the presence of microtubules. Elimination of one such interaction in human cells caused checkpoint defects expected from a failure to detect unattached kinetochores. Competition between Mps1 and microtubules for Ndc80C binding thus constitutes a direct mechanism for the detection of unattached kinetochores.},

abstract = {The eukaryotic RNA exosome participates extensively in RNA processing and degradation. In human cells, three accessory factors (RBM7, ZCCHC8 and hMTR4) interact to form the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex, which directs a subset of non-coding RNAs for exosomal degradation. Here we elucidate how RBM7 is incorporated in the NEXT complex. We identify a proline-rich segment of ZCCHC8 as the interaction site for the RNA-recognition motif (RRM) of RBM7 and present the crystal structure of the corresponding complex at 2.0 {\AA} resolution. On the basis of the structure, we identify a proline-rich segment within the splicing factor SAP145 with strong similarity to ZCCHC8. We show that this segment of SAP145 not only binds the RRM region of another splicing factor SAP49 but also the RRM of RBM7. These dual interactions of RBM7 with the exosome and the spliceosome suggest a model whereby NEXT might recruit the exosome to degrade intronic RNAs.},

abstract = {Coronaviruses are responsible for upper and lower respiratory tract infections in humans. It is estimated that 1 to 10{\%} of the population suffers annually from cold-like symptoms related to infection with human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), an alphacoronavirus. The nucleocapsid (N) protein, the major structural component of the capsid, facilitates RNA packing, links the capsid to the envelope, and is also involved in multiple other processes, including viral replication and evasion of the immune system. Although the role of N protein in viral replication is relatively well described, no structural data are currently available regarding the N proteins of alphacoronaviruses. Moreover, our understanding of the mechanisms of RNA binding and nucleocapsid formation remains incomplete. In this study, we solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal domains (NTD, residues 10 to 140, and CTD, residues 221 to 340, respectively) of the N protein of HCoV-NL63, both at a 1.5-{\AA} resolution. Based on our structure of NTD solved here, we proposed and experimentally evaluated a model of RNA binding. The structure of the CTD reveals the mode of N protein dimerization. Overall, this study expands our understanding of the initial steps of N protein-nucleic acid interaction and may facilitate future efforts to control the associated infections. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are responsible for the common cold and other respiratory tract infections in humans. According to multiple studies, 1 to 10{\%} of the population is infected each year with HCoV-NL63. Viruses are relatively simple organisms composed of a few proteins and the nucleic acids that carry the information determining their composition. The nucleocapsid (N) protein studied in this work protects the nucleic acid from the environmental factors during virus transmission. This study investigated the structural arrangement of N protein, explaining the first steps of its interaction with nucleic acid at the initial stages of virus structure assembly. The results expand our understanding of coronavirus physiology and may facilitate future efforts to control the associated infections.},

MB007 is a high-affinity anti-(human GM-CSF) autoantibody isolated from a patient suffering from PAP which shows only modest neutralization of GM-CSF bioactivity. We describe the first crystal structure of a cytokine-directed human IgG1lambda autoantibody-binding fragment (Fab) at 1.9 A (1 A=0.1 nm) resolution. Its CDR3-H substantially differs from all VH7 germline IgG1 structures reported previously. We derive a reliable model of the antigen-autoantibody complex by using NMR chemical shift perturbation data in combination with computational methods. Superposition of the modelled complex structure with the human GM-CSF-GM-CSF ternary receptor complex reveals only little overlap between receptor and Fab when bound to GM-CSF. Our model provides a structural basis for understanding the mode of action of the MB007 autoantibody.},

Furthermore, increase in half-lives of IgG and albumin-based therapeutics has the potential to improve their efficacies, but there is a great need for robust methods for screening of relative FcRn-dependent recycling ability. Here, we report on a novel human endothelial cell-based recycling assay (HERA) that can be used for such pre-clinical screening. In HERA, rescue from degradation depends on FcRn, and engineered ligands are recycled in a manner that correlates with their half-lives in human FcRn transgenic mice. Thus, HERA is a novel cellular assay that can be used to predict how FcRn-binding proteins are rescued from intracellular degradation.},

abstract = {The DNase I accessibility and chromatin organization of genes within the nucleus do correlate to their transcriptional activity. Here, we show that both serum starvation and overexpression of Tip5, a key regulator of ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) repression, dictate DNase I accessibility, facilitate the association of rDNA with the nuclear matrix and thus regulate large-scale rDNA chromatin organization. Tip5 contains four AT-hooks and a TAM (Tip5/ARBP/MBD) domain, which were proposed to bind matrix-attachment regions (MARs) of the genome. Remarkably, the TAM domain of Tip5 functions as nucleolar localization and nuclear matrix targeting module, whereas AT-hooks do not mediate association with the nuclear matrix, but they are required for nucleolar targeting. These findings suggest a dual role for Tip5's AT-hooks and TAM domain, targeting the nucleolus and anchoring to the nuclear matrix, and suggest a function for Tip5 in the regulation of higher-order rDNA chromatin structure.},

The CRISPR-Cpf1 system, a new class 2 CRISPR-Cas system, mediates robust DNA interference in human cells. Although functionally conserved, Cpf1 and Cas9 differ in many aspects including their guide RNAs and substrate specificity. Here we report the 2.38 {\AA} crystal structure of the CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-bound Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006 Cpf1 (LbCpf1). LbCpf1 has a triangle-shaped architecture with a large positively charged channel at the centre. Recognized by the oligonucleotide-binding domain of LbCpf1, the crRNA adopts a highly distorted conformation stabilized by extensive intramolecular interactions and the (Mg(H2O)6)(2+) ion. The oligonucleotide-binding domain also harbours a looped-out helical domain that is important for LbCpf1 substrate binding. Binding of crRNA or crRNA lacking the guide sequence induces marked conformational changes but no oligomerization of LbCpf1. Our study reveals the crRNA recognition mechanism and provides insight into crRNA-guided substrate binding of LbCpf1, establishing a framework for engineering LbCpf1 to improve its efficiency and specificity for genome editing.},

We used computational design methods to predict and optimize a total of 53 cyclic and linear peptides targeting myeloid differentiation 2 (MD2) and cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14), both coreceptors of human TLR4. Activity of the designed peptides was first assessed using NF-kB reporter cell lines expressing either TLR4/MD2 or TLR4/CD14 receptors, then binding to CD14 and MD2 confirmed and quantified using MicroScale Thermophoresis. Finally, we incubated select peptides in human whole blood and observed their ability to induce cytokine production, either alone or in synergy with LPS. Our data demonstrate the advantage of computational design for the discovery of new TLR4 peptide activators with little structural resemblance to known ligands and indicate an efficient strategy with which to identify TLR4 targeting peptides that could be used as easy-to-produce alternatives to LPS-derived molecules in a variety of settings.},

abstract = {Aggregation is a common challenge in the optimization of therapeutic antibody formulations. Since initial self-association of two monomers is typically a reversible process, the aim of this study is to identify different excipients that are able to shift this equilibrium to the monomeric state. The hypothesis is that a specific interaction between excipient and antibody may hinder two monomers from approaching each other, based on previous work in which dexamethasone phosphate showed the ability to partially reverse formed aggregates of the monoclonal IgG1 antibody bevacizumab back into monomers. The current study focuses on the selection of therapeutically inactive compounds with similar properties. Adenosine monophosphate, adenosine triphosphate, sucrose-6-phosphate and guanosine monophosphate were selected in silico through similarity searching and docking. All four compounds were predicted to bind to a protein-protein interaction hotspot on the Fc region of bevacizumab and thereby breaking dimer formation. The predictions were supported in vitro: An interaction between AMP and bevacizumab with a dissociation constant of 9.59+/-0.15mM was observed by microscale thermophoresis. The stability of the antibody at elevated temperature (40 degrees C) in a 51mM phosphate buffer pH 7 was investigated in presence and absence of the excipients. Quantification of the different aggregation species by asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation and size exclusion chromatography demonstrates that all four excipients are able to partially overcome the initial self-association of bevacizumab monomers.},

abstract = {The binding of four bromobenzotriazoles to the catalytic subunit of human protein kinase CK2 was assessed by two complementary methods: Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC). New algorithm proposed for the global analysis of MST pseudo-titration data enabled reliable determination of binding affinities for two distinct sites, a relatively strong one with the Kd of the order of 100 nM and a substantially weaker one (Kd {\textgreater} 1 $\mu$M). The affinities for the strong binding site determined for the same protein-ligand systems using ITC were in most cases approximately 10-fold underestimated. The discrepancy was assigned directly to the kinetics of ligand nano-aggregates decay occurring upon injection of the concentrated ligand solution to the protein sample. The binding affinities determined in the reverse ITC experiment, in which ligands were titrated with a concentrated protein solution, agreed with the MST-derived data. Our analysis suggests that some ITC-derived Kd values, routinely reported together with PDB structures of protein-ligand complexes, may be biased due to the uncontrolled ligand (nano)-aggregation, which may occur even substantially below the solubility limit.},

abstract = {Understanding the molecular interactions between small molecules and double-stranded DNA has important implications on the design and development of DNA and DNA-protein nanomaterials. Such materials can be assembled into a vast array of 1-, 2-, and 3D structures that contain a range of chemical and physical features where small molecules can bind via intercalation, groove binding, and electrostatics. In this work, we use a series of simulation-guided binding assays and spectroscopy techniques to investigate the binding of selected organophosphtates, methyl parathion, paraoxon, their common enzyme hydrolysis product p-nitrophenol, and double-stranded DNA fragments and DNA DX tiles, a basic building block of DNA-based materials. Docking simulations suggested that the binding strength of each compound was DNA sequence-dependent, with dissociation constants in the micromolar range. Microscale thermophoresis and fluorescence binding assays confirmed sequence-dependent binding and that paraoxon bound to DNA with Kd's between ∼10 and 300 $\mu$M, while methyl parathion bound with Kd's between ∼10 and 100 $\mu$M. p-Nitrophenol also bound to DNA but with affinities up to 650 $\mu$M. Changes in biding affinity were due to changes in binding mode as revealed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Based on these results, two DNA DX tiles were constructed and analyzed, revealing tighter binding to the studied compounds. Taken together, the results presented here add to our fundamental understanding of the molecular interactions of these compounds with biological materials and opens new possibilities in DNA-based sensors, DNA-based matrices for organophosphate extraction, and enzyme-DNA technologies for organophosphate hydrolysis.},

abstract = {The single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)/RNA binding protein translin was suggested to be involved in chromosomal translocations, telomere metabolism, and mRNA transport and translation. Oligonucleotide binding surfaces map within a closed cavity of translin octameric barrels, raising the question as to how DNA/RNA gain access to this inner cavity, particularly given that, to date, none of the barrel structures reported hint to an entryway. Here, we argue against a mechanism by which translin octamers may "dissociate and reassemble" upon RNA binding and report a novel "open"-barrel structure of human translin revealing a feasible DNA/RNA entryway into the cavity. Additionally, we report that translin not only is confined to binding of ssDNA oligonucleotides, or single-stranded extensions of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), but also can bind single-stranded sequences internally embedded in dsDNA molecules.},

abstract = {The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) plays a key role in mammal physiology and in the etiology and progression of inflammatory and oxidative stress-based diseases. In adults, RAGE expression is normally high only in the lung where the protein concentrates in the basal membrane of alveolar Type I epithelial cells. In diseases, RAGE levels increase in the affected tissues and sustain chronic inflammation. RAGE exists as a membrane glycoprotein with an ectodomain, a transmembrane helix and a short carboxyl-terminal tail, or as a soluble ectodomain that acts as a decoy receptor (sRAGE). VC1 domain is responsible for binding to the majority of RAGE ligands including advanced glycation end products (AGEs), S100 proteins and HMGB1. To ascertain whether other ligands exist, we analyzed by MS the material pulled-down by VC1 from human plasma. Twenty out of 295 identified proteins were selected and associated to coagulation and complement processes and to extracellular matrix. Four of them contained a $\gamma$-carboxyl glutamic acid (Gla)-domain, a calcium-binding module, and prothrombin (PT) was the most abundant. Using MicroScale Thermophoresis, we quantified the interaction of PT with VC1 and sRAGE in the absence or presence of calcium that acted as a competitor. PT devoid of the Gla-domain (PT des-Gla) did not bind to sRAGE, providing further evidence that the Gla-domain is critical for the interaction. Finally, the presence of VC1 delayed plasma clotting in a dose-dependent manner. We propose that RAGE is involved in modulating blood coagulation presumably in conditions of lung injury},

abstract = {To date, few structural models of VHH antibody binding to low molecular weight haptens have been reported. Here, we report the crystal structure of cortisol binding to its VHH antibody NbCor at pH 3.5 and 10.5. Cortisol binds to NbCor mainly by burying itself under the tunnel formed by the complementarity determining region 1 (CDR1) of NbCor. The affinity of NbCor binding to cortisol and similar compounds was also verified by a microscale thermophoresis assay. Combining our findings with several previously reported structures of hapten-VHH antibody complexes, we propose that VHH antibodies exhibit a special mechanism of binding small haptens by encapsulating them in a tunnel formed by CDR1. Our findings provide useful structural information for the further development and optimization of hapten-specific VHH antibodies.},

Recently, nano differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) has emerged as a powerful tool for thermal stability analysis and studies of protein domain unfolding. Due to increased interests in the qualification of characterization methods, we are in this study presenting the qualification results for the comparability studies of thermal stability analysis using nanoDSF. The results show that nanoDSF is able to detect thermal transition signals for mAbs, BiTE{\textregistered} molecules, and cytokines at a wide concentration range with high precision, clearly indicating that nanoDSF is suitable for characterization including comparability studies of therapeutic proteins. Compared to the current recognized industry standard DSC, the nanoDSF method enables thermal stability analysis over a much wider concentration range, consumes considerably less materials, and provides significantly higher throughput.},

abstract = {Widely recognized as the gold standard for biological recognition, antibodies have been used to develop bioscavengers, enzyme-like catalytic therapies, and highly specific diagnostic clinical tests. The discovery of camelid antibodies in the 1990s has extended the useful range of antibodies into pH extremes, high temperature, and high salt conditions due to increased stability. However, determining the binding properties of these molecules prior to use under these conditions has not been widely employed because the most precise biophysical methods, surface plasmon resonance, and isothermal titration calorimetry, are not compatible with highly complex matrices. Here we demonstrate the use of microscale thermophoresis as a rapid, simple method to detect binding of a single-domain antibody in the presence of jet fuel/water mixes; a complex, harsh environment. This work provides key data to quantifying binding for the development of a sensor for detection of microbial growth in fuel.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Homing endonucleases recognize and generate a DNA double-strand break, which has been used to promote gene targeting. These enzymes recognize long DNA stretches; they are highly sequence-specific enzymes and display a very low frequency of cleavage even in complete genomes. Although a large number of homing endonucleases have been identified, the landscape of possible target sequences is still very limited to cover the complexity of the whole eukaryotic genome. Therefore the finding and molecular analysis of homing endonucleases identified but not yet characterized may widen the landscape of possible target sequences. The previous characterization of protein-DNA interaction before the engineering of new homing endonucleases is essential for further enzyme modification. Here we report the crystal structure of I-CvuI in complex with its target DNA and with the target DNA of I-CreI, a homologue enzyme widely use in genome engineering. To characterize the enzyme cleavage mechanism we have solved the I-CvuI DNA structures in the presence of non-catalytic (Ca2+) and catalytic ions (Mg2+). We have also analyzed the metal dependence of DNA cleavage using Mg2+ ions at different concentrations ranging from non- cleavable to cleavable concentrations obtained from in vitro cleavage experiments. The structure of I-CvuI homing endonuclease expands the current repertoire for engineering custom specificities, both by itself as a new scaffold alone or in hybrid constructs with other related homing endonucleases or other DNA binding protein templates.},

We analyzed the effects of a new purine derivative drug, PDD005, in attenuating mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, using both in vivo and in vitro models. We show that PDD005 is distributed to the brain and can rescue cognitive deficits associated with aging in mice. Treatment with PDD005 prevents impairment of neurogenesis by increasing sex-determining region Y-box 2, nestin, and also enhances synaptic function through upregulation of synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein 95. PDD005 treatment also reduced neuro-inflammation by decreasing interleukin-1$\beta$ expression, activation of astrocytes, and microglia. We identified prohibitin as a potential target in mediating the therapeutic effects of PDD005 for the treatment of cognitive deficit in aging mice. Additionally, in the current study, glycogen synthase kinase appears to attenuate tau pathology.},

However, current structure-based methods are largely limited to natural peptides and are not suitable for designing target-specific binders with improved pharmaceutical properties, such as macrocyclic peptides. Here we report a general framework that leverages the computational power of Rosetta for large-scale backbone sampling and energy scoring, followed by side-chain composition, to design heterochiral cyclic peptides that bind to a protein surface of interest. To showcase the applicability of our approach, we identified two peptides (PD-i3 and PD-i6) that target PD-1, a key immune checkpoint, and work as protein ligand decoys. A comprehensive biophysical evaluation confirmed their binding mechanism to PD-1 and their inhibitory effect on the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. Finally, elucidation of their solution structures by NMR served as validation of our de novo design approach. We anticipate that our results will provide a general framework for designing target-specific drug-like peptides.},

Mutations in the genes encoding these proteins lead to Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC). NPC2 binds to NPC1's second (middle), lumenally oriented domain (MLD) and transfers cholesterol to NPC1's N-terminal domain (NTD). Here, we report the 2.4-A resolution crystal structure of a complex of human NPC1-MLD and NPC2 bearing bound cholesterol-3-O-sulfate. NPC1-MLD uses two protruding loops to bind NPC2, analogous to its interaction with the primed Ebola virus glycoprotein. Docking of the NPC1-NPC2 complex onto the full-length NPC1 structure reveals a direct cholesterol transfer tunnel between NPC2 and NTD cholesterol binding pockets, supporting the "hydrophobic hand-off" cholesterol transfer model.},

abstract = {Amyloid fibrils are a hallmark of a range of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. A detailed understanding of the physico-chemical properties of the different aggregated forms of proteins, and of their interactions with other compounds of diagnostic or therapeutic interest, is crucial for devising effective strategies against such diseases. Protein aggregates are situated at the boundary between soluble and insoluble structures, and are challenging to study because classical biophysical techniques, such as scattering, spectroscopic and calorimetric methods, are not well adapted for their study. Here we present a detailed characterization of the thermophoretic behavior of different forms of the protein $\alpha$-synuclein, whose aggregation is associated with Parkinson's disease. Thermophoresis is the directed net diffusional flux of molecules and colloidal particles in a temperature gradient. Because of their low volume requirements and rapidity, analytical methods based on this effect have considerable potential for high throughput screening for drug discovery. In this paper we rationalize and describe in quantitative terms the thermophoretic behavior of monomeric, oligomeric and fibrillar forms of $\alpha$-synuclein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that microscale thermophoresis (MST) is a valuable method for screening for ligands and binding partners of even such highly challenging samples as supramolecular protein aggregates.},

abstract = {The anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides uses different energy sources, depending on environmental conditions including aerobic respiration or, in the absence of oxygen, photosynthesis. Photosynthetic genes are repressed at high oxygen tension, but at intermediate levels their partial expression prepares the bacterium for using light energy. Illumination, however, enhances repression under semiaerobic conditions. Here, we describe molecular details of two proteins mediating oxygen and light control of photosynthesis-gene expression: the light-sensing antirepressor AppA and the transcriptional repressor PpsR. Our crystal structures of both proteins and their complex and hydrogen/deuterium-exchange data show that light activation of AppA-PpsR2 affects the PpsR effector region within the complex. DNA binding studies demonstrate the formation of a light-sensitive ternary AppA-PpsR-DNA complex. We discuss implications of these results for regulation by light and oxygen, highlighting new insights into blue light-mediated signal transduction.},

abstract = {Many pathogenic bacteria utilise sialic acids as an energy source or use them as an external coating to evade immune detection. As such, bacteria that colonise sialylated environments deploy specific transporters to mediate import of scavenged sialic acids. Here, we report a substrate-bound 1.95 {\AA} resolution structure and subsequent characterisation of SiaT, a sialic acid transporter from Proteus mirabilis. SiaT is a secondary active transporter of the sodium solute symporter (SSS) family, which use Na+ gradients to drive the uptake of extracellular substrates. SiaT adopts the LeuT-fold and is in an outward-open conformation in complex with the sialic acid N-acetylneuraminic acid and two Na+ ions. One Na+ binds to the conserved Na2 site, while the second Na+ binds to a new position, termed Na3, which is conserved in many SSS family members. Functional and molecular dynamics studies validate the substrate-binding site and demonstrate that both Na+ sites regulate N-acetylneuraminic acid transport.},

abstract = {Pectin methylesterases (PMEs) catalyze the demethylesterification of homogalacturonan domains of pectin in plant cell walls and are regulated by endogenous pectin methylesterase inhibitors (PMEIs). In Arabidopsis dark-grown hypocotyls, one PME (AtPME3) and one PMEI (AtPMEI7) were identified as potential interacting proteins. Using RT-qPCR analysis and gene promoter::GUS fusions, we first showed that AtPME3 and AtPMEI7 genes had overlapping patterns of expression in etiolated hypocotyls. The two proteins were identified in hypocotyl cell wall extracts by proteomics. To investigate the potential interaction between AtPME3 and AtPMEI7, both proteins were expressed in a heterologous system and purified by affinity chromatography. The activity of recombinant AtPME3 was characterized on homogalacturonans (HGs) with distinct degrees (DM)/patterns of methylesterification. AtPME3 showed the highest activity at pH 7.5 on HG substrates with a DM between 60{\%} and 80{\%} and a random distribution of methyl esters. On the best HG substrate, AtPME3 generates long non-methylesterified stretches and leaves short highly methylesterified zones indicating that it acts as a processive enzyme. The recombinant AtPMEI7 and AtPME3 interaction reduces the level of demethylesterification of the HG substrate but does not inhibit the processivity of the enzyme. These data suggest that the AtPME3/AtPMEI7 complex is not covalently linked and could, depending on the pH, be alternately formed and dissociated. Docking analysis indicated that the inhibition of AtPME3 could occur via the interaction of AtPMEI7 with a PME ligand-binding cleft structure. All these data indicate that AtPME3 and AtPMEI7 could be partners involved in the fine-tuning of HG methylesterification during plant development.},

abstract = {The venom of Cupiennius salei is composed of dozens of neurotoxins, with most of them supposed to act on ion channels. Some insecticidal monomeric neurotoxins contain an $\alpha$-helical part besides their inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) motif (type 1). Other neurotoxins have, besides the ICK motif, an $\alpha$-helical part of an open loop, resulting in a heterodimeric structure (type 2). Due to their low toxicity, it is difficult to understand the existence of type 2 peptides. Here, we show with the voltage clamp technique in oocytes of Xenopus laevis that a combined application of structural type 1 and type 2 neurotoxins has a much more pronounced cytolytic effect than each of the toxins alone. In biotests with Drosophila melanogaster, the combined effect of both neurotoxins was enhanced by 2 to 3 log units when compared to the components alone. Electrophysiological measurements of a type 2 peptide at 18 ion channel types, expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, showed no effect. Microscale thermophoresis data indicate a monomeric/heterodimeric peptide complex formation, thus a direct interaction between type 1 and type 2 peptides, leading to cell death. In conclusion, peptide mergers between both neurotoxins are the main cause for the high cytolytic activity of Cupiennius salei venom.},

abstract = {Studies to identify novel immune-regulatory functions of active vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) in human CD4+ T cells revealed that 1,25(OH)2D3 potently induced expression of the gene SERPINA1, encoding the anti-protease $\alpha$-1- antitrypsin. We confirmed $\alpha$-1-antitrypsin protein expression by 1,25(OH)2D3-treated CD4+ T cells, but not in CD8+ T cells or monocytes. $\alpha$-1-Antitrypsin promotes anti-inflammatory IL-10 synthesis in other immune cell populations. We therefore investigated its immune-regulatory effects in CD4+ T cells. Plasma-derived $\alpha$-1-antitrypsin drove IL-10 synthesis by CD4+ T cells, which was not dependent on anti-protease activity, but appeared to require a serum-binding factor, since this could not be achieved with recombinant protein. $\alpha$-1-Antitrypsin is reported to bind complement components, which regulate T cell function. A role for this interaction was therefore probed. Plasma-derived, but not recombinant $\alpha$-1-antitrypsin contained C3a. Surface Plasmon Resonance and Microscale Thermophoresis demonstrated $\alpha$-1-antitrypsin binding to C3a. Addition of C3a to CD4+ T cells cultured with recombinant $\alpha$-1-antitrypsin restored induction of IL-10, whereas neutralisation of C3a abrogated IL-10 induced by plasma-derived $\alpha$-1-antitrypsin. To interrogate an endogenous role for the $\alpha$-1- antitrypsin-C3a axis in 1,25(OH)2D3-driven CD4+ T cell IL-10 synthesis, we treated cells from healthy or $\alpha$-1- antitrypsin-deficient individuals (which transcribe SERPINA1 but do not secrete protein) with 1,25(OH)2D3. A significant correlation was identified between SERPINA1 and IL10 gene expression in healthy donor CD4+ T cells, which was absent in cells from $\alpha$-1-antitrypsin-deficient individuals. Therefore, $\alpha$-1-antitrypsin is required for 1,25(OH)2D3-induced IL-10 expression in CD4+ T cells, interacting with C3a to drive IL-10 expression.},

abstract = {Lipochitin oligosaccharides called Nod factors function as primary rhizobial signal molecules triggering legumes to develop new plant organs: root nodules that host the bacteria as nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. Here, we show that the Lotus japonicus Nod factor receptor 5 (NFR5) and Nod factor receptor 1 (NFR1) bind Nod factor directly at high-affinity binding sites. Both receptor proteins were posttranslationally processed when expressed as fusion proteins and extracted from purified membrane fractions of Nicotiana benthamiana or Arabidopsis thaliana. The N-terminal signal peptides were cleaved, and NFR1 protein retained its in vitro kinase activity. Processing of NFR5 protein was characterized by determining the N-glycosylation patterns of the ectodomain. Two different glycan structures with identical composition, Man(3)XylFucGlcNAc(4), were identified by mass spectrometry and located at amino acid positions N68 and N198. Receptor-ligand interaction was measured by using ligands that were labeled or immobilized by application of chemoselective chemistry at the anomeric center. High-affinity ligand binding was demonstrated with both solid-phase and free solution techniques. The K(d) values obtained for Nod factor binding were in the nanomolar range and comparable to the concentration range sufficient for biological activity. Structure-dependent ligand specificity was shown by using chitin oligosaccharides. Taken together, our results suggest that ligand recognition through direct ligand binding is a key step in the receptor-mediated activation mechanism leading to root nodule development in legumes.},

abstract = {The lymphatic system plays a major role in the metastatic dissemination of cancer and has an integral role in immunity. PEGylation enhances drainage and lymphatic uptake following subcutaneous (SC) administration of proteins and protein-like polymers, but the impact of PEGylation of very large proteins (such as antibodies) on subcutaneous and lymphatic pharmacokinetics is unknown. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the impact of PEGylation on the SC absorption and lymphatic disposition of the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab in rats. PEG-trastuzumab was generated via the conjugation of a single 40 kDa PEG-NHS ester to trastuzumab. PEG-trastuzumab showed a 5-fold reduction in HER2 binding affinity, however the in vitro growth inhibitory effects were preserved as a result of changes in cellular trafficking when compared to native trastuzumab. The lymphatic pharmacokinetics of PEG-trastuzumab was evaluated in thoracic lymph duct cannulated rats after IV and SC administration and compared to the pharmacokinetics of native trastuzumab. The IV pharmacokinetics and lymphatic exposure of PEG-trastuzumab was similar when compared to trastuzumab. After SC administration, initial plasma pharmacokinetics and lymphatic exposure were also similar between PEG-trastuzumab and trastuzumab, but the absolute bioavailability of PEG-trastuzumab was 100{\%} when compared to 86.1{\%} bioavailability for trastuzumab. In contrast to trastuzumab, PEG-trastuzumab showed accelerated plasma clearance beginning approximately 7 days after SC, but not IV, administration, presumably as a result of the generation of anti-PEG IgM. This work suggests that PEGylation does not significantly alter the lymphatic disposition of very large proteins, and further suggests that it is unlikely to benefit therapy with monoclonal antibodies.},

abstract = {Thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) play essential role in DNA synthesis, repair and cell division by catalyzing two subsequent reactions in thymidylate biosynthesis cycle. The lack of either enzyme leads to thymineless death of the cell, therefore inhibition of the enzyme activity is a common and successful tool in cancer chemotherapy and treatment of other diseases. However, the detailed mechanism of thymidylate synthesis cycle, especially the interactions between cycle enzymes and its role remain unknown.In this paper we are the first to show that human TS and DHFR enzymes form a strong complex which might be essential for DNA synthesis. Using two unique biosensor techniques, both highly sensitive to biomolecular interactions, namely quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) and microscale thermophoresis (MST) we have been able to determine DHFR-TS binding kinetic parameters such as the Kd value being below 10$\mu$M (both methods), kon=0.46×104M-1s-1 and koff=0.024s-1 (QCM-D). We also calculated Gibbs free energy as in the order of -30kJ/mol and DHFR/TS molar ratio pointing to binding of 6 DHFR monomers per 1 TS dimer (both methods). Moreover, our data from MST analysis have pointed to positive binding cooperativity in TS-DHFR complex formation. The results obtained with both methods are comparable and complementary. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Molecular motors of the myosin superfamily share a generic motor domain region. They commonly bind actin in an ATP-sensitive manner, exhibit actin-activated ATPase activity, and generate force and movement in this interaction. Class-18 myosins form heavy chain dimers and contain protein interaction domains located at their unique N-terminal extension. Here, we characterized human myosin-18A molecular function in the interaction with nucleotides, F-actin and its putative binding partner, the Golgi-associated phosphoprotein GOLPH3. We show that myosin 18A comprises two actin binding sites: one is located in the KE-rich region at the start of the N-terminal extension and appears to mediate ATP-independent binding to F-actin. The second actin-binding site resides in the generic motor domain and is regulated by nucleotide binding in the absence of intrinsic ATP hydrolysis competence. This core motor domain displays its highest actin affinity in the ADP state. Electron micrographs of myosin-18A motor domain-decorated F-actin filaments show periodic binding pattern independent of the nucleotide state. We show that the PDZ module mediates direct binding of myosin-18A to GOLPH3 and this interaction in turn modulates the actin binding properties of the N-terminal extension. Thus, myosin-18A can act as an actin-crosslinker with multiple regulatory modulators that targets interacting proteins or complexes to the actin-based cytoskeleton.},

abstract = {The plant hormone ethylene is a key regulator of plant growth, development and stress adaption. Ethylene perception and response are mediated by a family of integral membrane receptors (ETRs) localized at the ER-Golgi network. The biological function of these receptors relies on a protein-bound copper cofactor. Nonetheless, molecular processes and structures controlling assembly and integration of the metal into the functional plant hormone receptor are still unknown. Here, we have explored the molecular pathways of copper transfer from the plant cytosol to the ethylene receptor family by analyzing protein–protein interactions of receptors with soluble and membrane-bound plant copper carriers. Our results suggest that receptors primarily acquire their metal cofactor from copper transporter RESPONSIVE-TO-ANTAGONIST-1 (RAN1) which has been loaded with the transition metal beforehand by soluble copper carriers of the ATX1-family. In addition, we found evidence for a direct interaction of ETRs with soluble chaperones ANTIOXIDANT-1 (ATX1) and COPPER TRANSPORT PROTEIN (CCH) raising the possibility of a direct copper exchange between soluble chaperones and receptors.},

abstract = {The tremendous pandemic potential of coronaviruses was demonstrated twice in the past few decades by two global outbreaks of deadly pneumonia. Entry of coronaviruses into cells is mediated by the transmembrane spike glycoprotein S, which forms a trimer carrying receptor-binding and membrane fusion functions. S also contains the principal antigenic determinants and is the target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we present the structure of a mouse coronavirus S trimer ectodomain determined at 4.0 {\AA} resolution by single particle cryo-electron microscopy. It reveals the metastable pre-fusion architecture of S and highlights key interactions stabilizing it. The structure shares a common core with paramyxovirus F proteins, implicating mechanistic similarities and an evolutionary connection between these viral fusion proteins. The accessibility of the highly conserved fusion peptide at the periphery of the trimer indicates potential vaccinology strategies to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies against coronaviruses. Finally, comparison with crystal structures of human coronavirus S domains allows rationalization of the molecular basis for species specificity based on the use of spatially contiguous but distinct domains.},

Changes in temperature affect the capacity of H-NS to form multimers that condense DNA and restrict gene expression. However, the molecular mechanism through which H-NS senses temperature and other physiochemical parameters remains unclear and controversial. Combining structural, biophysical and computational analyses, we show that human body temperature promotes unfolding of the central dimerization domain, breaking up H-NS multimers. This unfolding event enables an autoinhibitory compact H-NS conformation that blocks DNA binding. Our integrative approach provides the molecular basis for H-NS– mediated environment-sensing and may open new avenues for the control of pathogenic multi-drug resistant bacteria.},

abstract = {Dendritic polyglycerols (dPG) are water soluble, polyether-based nanomaterials which hold great potential in diagnostic as well as therapeutic applications. In order to translate them for in vivo applications, a systematic assessment regarding their cell and tissue interactions as well as their metabolic fate in vivo is a crucial step. Herein, we explore the structure-activity relationship of three different sizes (ca. 3, 5, and 10 nm) of neutral dendritic polyglycerol (dPG) and their corresponding negatively charged sulfate analogs (dPGS) on their in vitro and in vivo characteristics. Cellular metabolic activity was studied in A431 and HEK293 cells. Biomolecular corona formation was determined using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, which showed an increased protein binding of the dPGS even with serum concentrations as low as 20{\%}. An in situ technique, microscale thermophoresis, was employed to address the binding affinities of these nanomaterials with serum proteins such as serum albumin, apo-transferrin, and fibrinogen. In addition, nanoparticle-cell interactions were studied in differentiated THP-1 cells which showed a charge dependent scavenger receptor-mediated uptake. In line with this data, detailed biodistribution and small animal PET imaging studies in Wistar rats using 68Ga-labeled dPG-/dPGS-NOTA conjugates showed that the neutral dPG-NOTA conjugates were quantitatively excreted via the kidneys with a subsequent hepatobiliary excretion with an increase in their size, whereas the polysulfated analogs (dPGS-NOTA) were sequestered preferentially in the liver and kidneys irrespective of their size. Taken together, this systematic study accentuates that the pharmacokinetics of dPGs is critically dependent on the overall size and charge and can be, fine-tuned for the intended requirements in nano-theranostics.},

abstract = {Guanine (G) quadruplexes (G4s) can be formed by G-rich sequences when stabilized by the binding of cations (typically K+ or Na+) and play an essential role in replication, recombination, transcription, and telomere maintenance. Understanding of the G4 folding process is crucial for determining their cellular functions. However, G4-K+ interactions and folding pathways are still not well understood. By using human telomeric G4 (hTG4) as an example, two binding states corresponding to two K+ cations binding to hTG4 were distinguished clearly and fitted precisely. The basic binding parameters during G4-K+ interactions were measured and calculated by taking advantage of microscale thermophoresis (MST), which monitors the changes in charge and size at the same time. The G-hairpin and G-triplex have been suggested as intermediates during G4 folding and unfolding. We further analyzed the equilibrium dissociation constants of 10 possible folding intermediates using MST; thus, the energetically favorable folding/unfolding pathways were proposed. The results might not only shed new light on G4-K+ interactions and G4 folding pathways but also provide an example for experimentally studying DNA-ion interactions.},

Characterization using size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering confirmed conjugation and the increase in molecular size, while Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that the secondary structure of the conjugate was not affected by coupling. Meanwhile, microcalorimetry and aggregation studies showed a significant increase in protein stability. Surface plasmon resonance and microscale thermopho- resis showed that the conjugate retained its nanomolar affinity, and finally, the pharmacokinetics of the HESylated protein exhibited a 6.5-fold increase in the half-life, and a 45-fold increase in the AUC.

As YTH domain-containing proteins bind N6mA-containing RNA in mammalian cells, we investigated whether mammalian YTH domains are also methyl mark readers of N6mA DNA. Here, we show that the YTH domain of YTHDC1 (known to localize in the nucleus) binds ssDNA containing N6mA, with a 10 nM dissociation constant. This binding is stronger by a factor of 5 than in an RNA context, tested under the same conditions. However, the YTH domains of YTHDF2 and YTHDF1 (predominantly cytoplasmic) exhibited the opposite effect with ∼1.5–2× stronger binding to ssRNA containing N6mA than to the corresponding DNA. We determined two structures of the YTH domain of YTHDC1 in complex with N6mA-containing ssDNA, which illustrated that YTHDC1 binds the methylated adenine in a single-stranded region flanked by duplexed DNA. We discuss the hypothesis that the writer-reader-eraser of N6mA-containining ssDNA is associated with maintaining genome stability. Structural comparison of YTH and SRA domains (the latter a DNA 5-methylcytosine reader) revealed them to be diverse members of a larger family of DNA/RNA modification readers, apparently having originated from bacterial modification-dependent restriction enzymes.},

Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is a genome-reduced pathogen of swine that lacks the genetic repertoire to synthesize amino acids and relies on the host for availability of amino acids for growth. M. hyopneumoniae recruits plasmin(ogen) onto its cell surface via the P97 and P102 adhesins and the glutamyl aminopeptidase MHJ{\_}0125. Plasmin plays an important role in regulating the inflammatory response in the lungs of pigs infected with M. hyopneumoniae. We show that recombinant MHJ{\_}0461 (rMHJ{\_}0461) functions as a leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) with broad substrate specificity for leucine, alanine, phenylalanine, methionine and arginine and that MHJ{\_}0461 resides on the surface of M. hyopneumoniae. rMHJ{\_}0461 also binds heparin, plasminogen and foreign DNA. Plasminogen bound to rMHJ{\_}0461 was readily converted to plasmin in the presence of tPA. Computational modelling identified putative DNA and heparin-binding motifs on solvent-exposed sites around a large pore on the LAP hexamer.

Negatively charged phosphate ions in the PBS solution ‘neutralize' the charges carried by hIAPP11–20 itself to some extent, causing rapid aggregation of hIAPP11–20, and leading to a shorter fibrillation process of hIAPP11–20. These results revealed that solvents contribute to the aggregation of hIAPP11–20 and demonstrated the affect of solvents on the activity of biomolecules. Additionally, as a new technique, microscale thermophoresis offers a powerful and promising approach to study the early stages of aggregation of peptides or proteins.},

Signal propagation from activated receptors to integrins depends on scaffolding proteins such as the adhesion and degranulation promoting adaptor protein (ADAP)(1). Here we have comprehensively investigated the phosphotyrosine interactome of ADAP in T cells and define known and novel interaction partners of functional relevance. While most phosphosites reside in unstructured regions of the protein, thereby defining classical SH2 domain interaction sites for master regulators of T cell signaling such as SLP76, Fyn-kinase, and NCK, other binding events depend on structural context. Interaction proteomics using different ADAP constructs comprising most of the known phosphotyrosine motifs as well as the structured domains confirm that a distinct set of proteins is attracted by pY571 of ADAP, including the $\zeta$-chain-associated protein kinase of 70 kDa (ZAP70). The interaction of ADAP and ZAP70 is inducible upon stimulation either of the T cell receptor (TCR) or by chemokine. NMR spectroscopy reveals that the N-terminal SH2 domains within a ZAP70-tandem-SH2 construct is the major site of interaction with phosphorylated ADAP-hSH3(N) and microscale thermophoresis (MST) indicates an intermediate binding affinity (Kd = 2.3 $\mu$m). Interestingly, although T cell receptor dependent events such as T cell/antigen presenting cell (APC) conjugate formation and adhesion are not affected by mutation of Y571, migration of T cells along a chemokine gradient is compromised. Thus, although most phospho-sites in ADAP are linked to T cell receptor related functions we have identified a unique phosphotyrosine that is solely required for chemokine induced T cell behavior.},

abstract = {The availability of well characterized allosteric modulators is of crucial importance for investigating allosteric regulation of protein function. In a recently identified inactive conformation of CDK2 an open allosteric pocket has been detected and proposed as a site to accommodate allosteric inhibitors. Previous structure-based approaches allowed the identification of a hit compound expected to bind to this pocket. Here, we report the characterization of this compound by X-ray crystallography, which surprisingly provided a chemical structure different from the one previously reported. Therefore, the compound was synthesized and completely characterized. X-ray structures of the synthesized and purchased compounds were superimposable. A reaction mechanism was proposed to explain the formation of the structure indicated by X-ray. Moreover, a stereoselective synthesis was developed to evaluate the biological activity of the pure stereoisomers. Modeling studies were performed to unveil the details of the interaction with CDK2. Then, the activity of the obtained compounds was evaluated with different biological assays. Mutagenesis experiments confirmed binding to the allosteric pocket. Finally, the allosteric ligands were shown to inhibit the growth of A549 and SKOV3 cancer cell lines. Therefore, this paper presents a thorough chemical and biological characterization of the first small-molecule ligands to be used as probes to study the allosteric modulation of CDK2 activity.},

abstract = {Leucocyte common antigen-related protein (LAR) is a post-synaptic type I transmembrane receptor protein that is important for neuronal functionality and is genetically coupled to neuronal disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). To understand the molecular function of LAR, structural and biochemical studies of protein fragments derived from the ectodomain of human LAR have been performed. The crystal structure of a fragment encompassing the first four FNIII domains (LARFN1-4) showed a characteristic L shape. SAXS data suggested limited flexibility within LARFN1-4, while rigid-body refinement of the SAXS data using the X-ray-derived atomic model showed a smaller angle between the domains defining the L shape compared with the crystal structure. The capabilities of the individual LAR fragments to interact with heparin was examined using microscale thermophoresis and heparin-affinity chromatography. The results showed that the three N-terminal immunoglobulin domains (LARIg1-3) and the four C-terminal FNIII domains (LARFN5-8) both bound heparin, while LARFN1-4 did not. The low-molecular-weight heparin drug Innohep induced a shift in hydrodynamic volume as assessed by size-exclusion chromatography of LARIg1-3 and LARFN5-8, while the chemically defined pentameric heparin drug Arixtra did not. Together, the presented results suggest the presence of an additional heparin-binding site in human LAR.},

PepT1 and PepT2 also play an important role in drug transport in the human body. Recent crystal structures of bacterial homologs revealed a conserved peptide-binding site and mechanism of transport. However, a key structural difference exists between bacterial and mammalian homologs with only the latter containing a large extracellular domain, the function of which is currently unknown. Here, we present the crystal structure of the extracellular domain from both PepT1 and PepT2 that reveal two immunoglobulin-like folds connected in tandem, providing structural insight into mammalian peptide transport. Functional and biophysical studies demonstrate that these domains interact with the intestinal protease trypsin, suggesting a role in clustering proteolytic activity to the site of peptide transport in eukaryotic cells.},

abstract = {Autophagic receptor p62 is a critical mediator of cell detoxification, stress response, and metabolic programs and is commonly deregulated in human diseases. The diverse functions of p62 arise from its ability to interact with a large set of ligands, such as arginylated (Nt-R) substrates. Here, we describe the structural mechanism for selective recognition of Nt-R by the ZZ domain of p62 (p62ZZ). We show that binding of p62ZZ to Nt-R substrates stimulates p62 aggregation and macroautophagy and is required for autophagic targeting of p62. p62 is essential for mTORC1 activation in response to arginine, but it is not a direct sensor of free arginine in the mTORC1 pathway. We identified a regulatory linker (RL) region in p62 that binds p62ZZ in vitro and may modulate p62 function. Our findings shed new light on the mechanistic and functional significance of the major cytosolic adaptor protein p62 in two fundamental signaling pathways.},

abstract = {During their synthesis the C-tailed membrane proteins expose the membrane-spanning segment late from the ribosome and consequently can insert into the membrane only post-translationally. However, the C-tailed T6SS component SciP uses the bacterial SRP system for membrane targeting which operates co-translationally. Analysis of possible sequence regions in the amino-terminal part of the protein revealed two candidates that were then tested whether they function as SRP signal peptides. Both sequences were tested positive as synthetic peptides for binding to SRP. In addition, purified ribosomes with stalled nascent chains exposing either sequence were capable to bind to SRP and to SRP-FtsY complexes with high affinity. Together, the data suggest that both peptides can serve as SRP signal sequence promoting an early membrane targeting of SciP during its synthesis. Like observed for multi-spanning membrane proteins, the two cytoplasmic SRP signal sequences of SciP may also facilitate a re-targeting event, making the targeting more efficient. Importance C-tail proteins are anchored in the inner membrane with a transmembrane segment at the C-terminus in a N-in/C-out topology. Due to this topology the membrane insertion occurs only post-translationally. Nevertheless, the C-tail anchored protein SciP is targeted co-translationally by SRP. We report here that two cytoplasmic hydrophobic stretches in SciP are individually recognized by SRP and target the nascent protein to FtsY. The presence of two signal sequences may enable a re-targeting mechanism as already observed for multi-spanning membrane proteins, to make the post-translational insertion of SciP by YidC more efficient.},

abstract = {UHRF1 is an important epigenetic regulator associated with apoptosis and tumour development. It is a multidomain protein that integrates readout of different histone modification states and DNA methylation with enzymatic histone ubiquitylation activity. Emerging evidence indicates that the chromatinbinding and enzymatic modules of UHRF1 do not act in isolation but interplay in a coordinated and regulated manner. Here, we compared two splicing variants (V1, V2) of murine UHRF1 (mUHRF1) with human UHRF1 (hUHRF1).We showthat insertion of nine amino acids in a linker region connecting the different TTD and PHD histone modification-binding domains causes distinct H3K9me3-binding behaviour of mUHRF1 V1. Structural analysis suggests that in mUHRF1 V1, in contrast to V2 and hUHRF1, the linker is anchored in a surface groove of the TTD domain, resulting in creation of a coupled TTD-PHD module. This establishesmultivalent, synergistic H3- tail binding causing distinct cellular localization and enhanced H3K9me3-nucleosome ubiquitylation activity. In contrast to hUHRF1, H3K9me3-binding of the murine proteins is not allosterically regulated by phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate that interacts with a separate less-conserved polybasic linker region of the protein. Our results highlight the importance of flexible linkers in regulating multidomain chromatin binding proteins and point to divergent evolution of their regulation.},

Application of the method to STAT3-GFP transiently expressed in HEK293 cells allowed to determine for the first time the affinity of the well-studied transcription factor to oligonucleotides with different sequences.

However, virtually no information exists on the contribution of other HDAC6 domains on tubulin recognition. Here, using recombinant protein expression, site-directed mutagenesis, fluorimetric and biochemical assays, microscale thermophoresis, and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we identified the N-terminal, disordered region of HDAC6 as a microtubule-binding domain (MBD) and functionally characterized it to the single-molecule level. We show that the microtubule-binding motif spans two positively charged patches comprising residues Lys-32 to Lys-58. We found that HDAC6-microtubule interactions are entirely independent of the catalytic domains and are mediated by ionic interactions with the negatively charged microtubule surface. Importantly, a crosstalk between the MBD and the deacetylase domain was critical for recognition and efficient deacetylation of free tubulin dimers both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our results reveal that recognition of substrates by HDAC6 is more complex than previously appreciated, and that domains outside the tandem catalytic core are essential for proficient substrate deacetylation.},

It is a unique member of class-II HDAC enzymes. It possesses two catalytic domains, which function independently of the overall enzyme activity. Up to date, there are only a few selective HDAC6 inhibitors with anti-cancer activity. In this study, 175,204 ligands obtained from the ZINC15 and OTAVAchemical databases were used for virtual drug screening against HDAC6. Molecular docking studies were performed for 100 selected compounds. Furthermore, the top 10 compounds obtained from docking were tested for their efficacy to inhibit the function of HDAC6. Five compounds (N-(9-oxo-9H-fluoren-3-yl)benzamide, 2-hydroxy-5-[(5-oxo-6-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)amino]benzoic acid, 5-(4-bromonaphthalene-1-sulfonamido)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 2-(naphthalen-2-yl)-N-(1H-1,2,3,4-tetrazol-5-yl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamide, and 4-oxa-5,6 diazapentacyclo[10.7.1.0³,⁷.0⁸,²⁰.0¹⁴,¹⁹]icosa-1,3(7),5,8(20),9,11,14,16,18-nonaen-13-one) inhibited enzymatic activity by more than 50 {\%} compared to DMSO as the control.

Microscale thermophoresis revealed the binding of N-(9-oxo-9H-fluoren-3-yl)benzamide and 5-(4-bromonaphthalene-1-sulfonamido)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid to purified HDAC6 protein. Both compounds induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner as analyzed by flow cytometry.

abstract = {Temperate viruses can become dormant in their host cells, a process called lysogeny. In every infection, such viruses decide between the lytic and the lysogenic cycles, that is, whether to replicate and lyse their host or to lysogenize and keep the host viable. Here we show that viruses (phages) of the SPbeta group use a small-molecule communication system to coordinate lysis–lysogeny decisions. During infection of its Bacillus host cell, the phage produces a six aminoacids-long communication peptide that is released into the medium. In subsequent infections, progeny phages measure the concentration of this peptide and lysogenize if the concentration is sufficiently high. We found that different phages encode different versions of the communication peptide, demonstrating a phage-specific peptide communication code for lysogeny decisions. We term this communication system the ‘arbitrium' system, and further show that it is encoded by three phage genes: aimP, which produces the peptide; aimR, the intracellular peptide receptor; and aimX, a negative regulator of lysogeny. The arbitrium system enables a descendant phage to ‘communicate' with its predecessors, that is, to estimate the amount of recent previous infections and hence decide whether to employ the lytic or lysogenic cycle.},

abstract = {Protein import of nuclear- encoded proteins into plant chloroplasts is a highly regulated process, requiring fine-tuning mechanisms especially during chloroplast differentiation. One way of altering the import efficiency is achieved by phosphorylation of chloroplast transit peptides in the cytosol. Recently, we have investigated the role of three serine/threonine/tyrosine (STY) kinases, STY8, STY17, and STY46, in precursor phosphorylation. These three kinases share a high degree of similarity and harbor a conserved ACT domain upstream of the kinase domain. The ACT domain is a widely distributed structural motif, known to be important for the allosteric regulation of many enzymes. In this work, using biochemical and biophysical techniques both in vitro and in planta, including kinase assays, microscale thermophoresis, size-exclusion chromatography, as well as site-directed mutagenesis approaches, we show that the ACT domain regulates autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation of the STY kinases. We found that isoleucine and S-adenosylmethionine bind to the ACT domain, negatively influencing its autophosphorylation ability. Moreover, we investigated the role of the ACT domain in planta and confirmed its involvement in chloroplast differentiation in vivo. Our results provide detailed insights into the regulation of enzyme activity by ACT domains and establish that it has a role in binding amino acid ligands during chloroplast biogenesis.},

abstract = {Phytosulfokine (PSK) is a disulfated pentapeptide that has a ubi- quitous role in plant growth and development1,2 . PSK is perceived by its receptor PSKR3,4 , a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR- RK). The mechanisms underlying the recognition of PSK, the activation of PSKR and the identity of the components down- stream of the initial binding remain elusive. Here we report the crystal structures of the extracellular LRR domain of PSKR in free, PSK- and co-receptor-bound forms. The structures reveal thatPSK interacts mainly with a b-strand from the island domain of PSKR, forming an anti-b-sheet. The two sulfate moieties of PSK interact directly with PSKR, sensitizing PSKR recognition of PSK. Supported by biochemical, structural and genetic evidence, PSK binding enhances PSKR heterodimerization with the somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinases (SERKs). However, PSK is not directly involved in PSKR–SERK interaction but stabilizes PSKR island domain for recruitment of a SERK. Our data reveal the structural basis for PSKR recognition of PSK and allosteric activation of PSKR by PSK, opening up new avenues for the design of PSKR-specific small molecules.},

abstract = {The rules of the genetic code are established by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) enzymes, which covalently link tRNA with the cognate amino acid. Many aaRSs are involved in diverse cellular processes beyond translation, acting alone, or in complex with other proteins. However, studies of aaRS noncanonical assembly and functions in plants are scarce, as are structural studies of plant aaRSs. Here, we have solved the crystal structure of Arabidopsis thaliana cytosolic seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS), which is the first crystallographic structure of a plant aaRS. Arabidopsis SerRS displays structural features typical of canonical SerRSs, except for a unique intrasubunit disulfide bridge. In a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified BEN1, a protein involved in the metabolism of plant brassinosteroid hormones, as a protein interactor of Arabidopsis SerRS. The SerRS:BEN1 complex is one of the first protein complexes of plant aaRSs discovered so far, and is a rare example of an aaRS interacting with an enzyme involved in primary or secondary metabolism. To pinpoint regions responsible for this interaction, we created truncated variants of SerRS and BEN1, and identified that the interaction interface involves the SerRS globular catalytic domain and the N-terminal extension of BEN1 protein. BEN1 does not have a strong impact on SerRS aminoacylation activity, indicating that the primary function of the complex is not the modification of SerRS canonical activity. Perhaps SerRS performs as yet unknown noncanonical functions mediated by BEN1. These findings indicate that – via SerRS and BEN1 – a link exists between the protein translation and steroid metabolic pathways of the plant cell.},

abstract = {The Protein Disulfide Isomerase PDI is involved in VWF dimerization by initiating disulfide bond formation at cysteines 2771 and 2773.Von Willebrand disease-associated mutations in the dimerization domain of von Willebrand factor disturb processing by PDI. Multimeric von Willebrand factor (VWF) is essential for primary hemostasis. The biosynthesis of VWF high molecular weight multimers requires spatial separation of each step due to varying pH value requirements. VWF is dimerized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by formation of disulfide bonds between the CK domains of two monomers. Here, we investigated the basic question which protein catalyzes the dimerization. We examined the putative interaction of VWF and the protein disulfide isomerase PDIA1, which has previously been used to visualize ER localization of VWF. Excitingly, we were able to visualize the PDI-VWF-dimer-complex by high-resolution STORM and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). We proved and quantified direct binding of PDIA1 to VWF using Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) and Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) (dissociation constants KD = 236±66 nM and KD = 282±123 nM by MST and FCS, respectively). The similar KD (258±104 nM) measured for PDI interaction with the isolated CK domain and the AFM images strongly indicate that PDIA1 binds exclusively to the CK domain, suggesting a key role of PDIA1 in VWF dimerization. Based on protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics simulations, combined with fluorescence microscopy studies of VWF CK-domain-mutants, we suggest the following mechanism of VWF dimerization: PDI initiates VWF dimerization by forming the first two disulfide bonds Cys2771-2773' and Cys2771'-2773. Subsequently, the third bond Cys2811-2811' is formed, presumably, to protect the first two bonds from reduction, thereby rendering dimerization irreversible. This study deepens our understanding of the mechanism of VWF dimerization and the pathophysiological consequences of its inhibition.},

abstract = {ALKBH7 is the mitochondrial AlkB family member which is required for alkylation and oxidation-induced programmed necrosis. In contrast to the protective role of other AlkB family members after suffering alkylation induced DNA damage, ALKBH7 triggers the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and promotes cell death. Moreover, genetic ablation of mouse Alkbh7 dramatically increases body weight and fat mass. Here, we present crystal structures of human ALKBH7 in complex with Mn(II) and $\alpha$-KG at 1.35 {\AA} or N-oxalylglycine at 2.0 {\AA} resolution. ALKBH7 possesses the conserved double-stranded $\beta$-helix (DSBH) fold that coordinates a catalytically active iron by a conserved HXD/E-Xn-H motif. Self-hydroxylation of Leu110 was observed, indicating that ALKBH7 has the potential to catalyze hydroxylation of its substrate. Unlike other AlkB family members whose substrates are DNA or RNA, ALKBH7 is devoid of the 'nucleotide recognition lid' which is essential for binding nucleobases, and thus exhibits a solvent exposed active site; two loops between $\beta$-strands $\beta$6 and $\beta$7, $\beta$9 and $\beta$10 create a special outer wall of the minor $\beta$ sheet of DSBH and form a negatively charged groove. These distinct features suggest that ALKBH7 may act on protein substrate rather than nucleic acids. Taken together, our findings provide a structural basis for understanding the distinct function of ALKBH7 in AlkB family and offer a foundation for drug design in treating cell death related diseases and metabolic diseases.},

Here, we present the crystal structure of the human Myo1c motor in complex with its light chain calmodulin. Our structure reveals tight interactions of the motor domain with calmodulin bound to the first IQ motif in the neck region. Several of the calmodulin residues contributing to this interaction are also involved in Ca2+ binding. Contact residues in the motor domain are linked to the central $\beta$-sheet and the HO helix, suggesting a mechanism for communicating changes in Ca2+ binding in the neck region to the actin and nucleotide binding regions of the motor domain. The structural context and the chemical environment of Myo1c mutations that are involved in sensorineural hearing loss in humans are described and their impact on motor function is discussed. We show that a construct consisting of the motor domain of Myo1c and the first IQ motif is sufficient to establish a tight interaction with 14-3-3$\beta$ (KD = 0.9 $\mu$M) and present the model of a double-headed Myo1c–14-3-3 complex.

abstract = {In chlorophyll biosynthesis, the magnesium chelatase enzyme complex catalyzes the insertion of a Mg(2+) ion into protoporphyrin IX. Prior to this event, two of the three subunits, the AAA(+) proteins ChlI and ChlD, form a ChlID-MgATP complex. We used microscale thermophoresis to directly determine dissociation constants for the I-D subunits from Synechocystis, and to show that the formation of a ChlID-MgADP complex, mediated by the arginine finger and the sensor II domain on ChlD, is necessary for the assembly of the catalytically active ChlHID-MgATP complex. The N-terminal AAA(+) domain of ChlD is essential for complex formation, but some stability is preserved in the absence of the C-terminal integrin domain of ChlD, particularly if the intervening polyproline linker region is retained. Single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) was used to determine the factors that stabilize formation of the ChlID-MgADP complex at the single molecule level; ChlD was attached to an atomic force microscope (AFM) probe in two different orientations, and the ChlI subunits were tethered to a silica surface; the probability of subunits interacting more than doubled in the presence of MgADP, and we show that the N-terminal AAA(+) domain of ChlD mediates this process, in agreement with the microscale thermophoresis data. Analysis of the unbinding data revealed a most probable interaction force of around 109 pN for formation of single ChlID-MgADP complexes. These experiments provide a quantitative basis for understanding the assembly and function of the Mg chelatase complex.},

abstract = {Hageman factor (FXIIa) initiates the intrinsic coagulation pathway and triggers the kallikrein-kinin and the complement systems. In addition, it functions as a growth factor by expressing promitogenic activities toward several cell types. FXIIa binds to the cell surface via a number of structurally unrelated surface receptors; however, the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that FXIIa utilizes cell membrane-bound glycosaminoglycans to interact with the cell surface of human lung fibroblasts (HLF). The combination of enzymatic, inhibitory, and overexpression approaches identified a heparan sulfate (HS) component of proteoglycans as an important determinant of the FXIIa binding capacity of HLF. Moreover, cell-free assays and competition experiments revealed preferential binding of FXIIa to HS and heparin over dextran sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate A and C. Finally, we demonstrate that fibroblasts isolated from the lungs of the patients suffering from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) exhibit enhanced FXIIa binding capacity. Increased sulfation of HS resulting from elevated HS 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 expression in IPF HLF accounted, in part, for this phenomenon. Application of RNA interference technology and inhibitors of intracellular sulfation revealed the cooperative action of cell surface-associated HS and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor in the accumulation of FXIIa on the cell surface of IPF HLF. Moreover, FXIIa stimulated IPF HLF migration, which was abrogated by pretreatment of cells with heparinase I. Collectively, our study uncovers a novel role of HS-type glycosaminoglycans in a local accumulation of FXIIa on the cell membrane. The enhanced association of FXIIa with IPF HLF suggests its contribution to fibrogenesis.},

abstract = {A unique aspect of arrestin-3 is its ability to support both receptor-dependent and receptor-independent signaling. Here, we show that inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) is a non-receptor activator of arrestin-3 and report the structure of IP6-activated arrestin-3 at 2.4-{\AA} resolution. IP6-activated arrestin-3 exhibits an inter-domain twist and a displaced C-tail, hallmarks of active arrestin. IP6 binds to the arrestin phosphate sensor, and is stabilized by trimerization. Analysis of the trimerization surface, which is also the receptor-binding surface, suggests a feature called the finger loop as a key region of the activation sensor. We show that finger loop helicity and flexibility may underlie coupling to hundreds of diverse receptors and also promote arrestin-3 activation by IP6. Importantly, we show that effector-binding sites on arrestins have distinct conformations in the basal and activated states, acting as switch regions. These switch regions may work with the inter-domain twist to initiate and direct arrestin-mediated signaling.},

abstract = {The adaptor protein growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) is ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic cells and involved in a multitude of intracellular protein interactions. Grb2 plays a pivotal role in tyrosine kinase-mediated signal transduction including linking receptor tyrosine kinases to the Ras/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, which is implicated in oncogenic outcome. Grb2 exists in a constitutive equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric states. Here we show that only monomeric Grb2 is capable of binding to SOS and upregulating MAP kinase signalling and that the dimeric state is inhibitory to this process. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 160 (Y160) on Grb2, or binding of a tyrosylphosphate-containing ligand to the SH2 domain of Grb2, results in dimer dissociation. Phosphorylation of Y160 on Grb2 is readily detectable in the malignant forms of human prostate, colon and breast cancers. The self-association/dissociation of Grb2 represents a switch that regulates MAP kinase activity and hence controls cancer progression.},

We have identified and determined the structure of a stable domain (CHD4-N) in this N-terminal region. The-fold consists of a four-$\alpha$-helix bundle with structural similarity to the high mobility group box, a domain that is well known as a DNA binding module. We show that the CHD4-N domain binds with higher affinity to poly(ADP-ribose) than to DNA. We also show that the N-terminal region of CHD4, although not CHD4-N alone, is essential for full nucleosome remodeling activity and is important for localizing CHD4 to sites of DNA damage. Overall, these data build on our understanding of how CHD4-NuRD acts to regulate gene expression and participates in the DNA-damage response.},

abstract = {AbstractBackground Equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) facilitate the import of nucleosides and their analogs into cells in a bidirectional, non-concentrative manner. However, in contrast to their name, most characterized plant ENTs act in a concentrative manner. A direct characterization of any ENT protein has been hindered due to difficulties in overexpression and obtaining pure recombinant protein. Methods The equilibrative nucleoside transporter 7 from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtENT7) was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes to assess mechanism of substrate uptake. Recombinant protein fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) was expressed in Pichia pastoris to characterize the protein by gel filtration and substrate binding by microscale thermophoresis (MST). Results AtENT7 expressed in X. laevis oocytes works as a classic equilibrative transporter. The expression of AtENT7-eGFP in the P. pastoris system yielded milligram amounts of pure protein that are stable homodimers. The concentration dependent binding of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides to the purified recombinant protein, assessed by MST, confirmed that AtENT7-eGFP is properly folded. For the first time the binding of nucleobases was observed for AtENT7. Significance The availability of pure recombinant AtENT7 will permit detailed kinetic and structural studies of this unique member of the ENT family and, given the functional similarity to mammalian ENTs, will serve as a good model for understanding the structural basis of translocation mechanism for the family.},

Rhosin contains two aromatic rings tethered by a linker, and it binds to the surface area sandwiching Trp58 of RhoA with a submicromolar Kd and effectively inhibits GEF-catalyzed RhoA activation. In cells, Rhosin specifically inhibited RhoA activity and RhoA-mediated cellular function without affecting Cdc42 or Rac1 signaling activities. By suppressing RhoA or RhoC activity, Rhosin could inhibit mammary sphere formation by breast cancer cells, suppress invasion of mammary epithelial cells, and induce neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells in synergy with NGF. Thus, the rational designed RhoA subfamily-specific small molecule inhibitor is useful for studying the physiological and pathologic roles of Rho GTPase.},

We devised and validated an autocompetitive strategy to independently fit the concentration and dissociation constant of autoimmune antibodies against the cardiac ?1-adrenergic receptor related to dilated cardiomyopathy. As an artificial antigen, the peptide COR1 was designed to mimic the second extracellular receptor loop. Thermophoresis resolved antibody concentrations from 2 to 200 nM and measured the dissociation constant as 75 nM. The approach quantifies antibody binding in its native serum environment within microliter volumes and without any surface attachments. The simplicity of the mix and probe protocol minimizes systematic errors, making thermophoresis a promising detection method for personalized medicine.},

The main goal of this study was to develop an approach for predicting protein targets for chemical toxins using a molecular similarity search of toxin-target information collected in the Toxin and Toxin-Target Database. The developed method was used to identify new targets for toluene which could predict potential cellular toxicity and to validate the approach with in vitro laboratory studies. We obtained 124 potential targets for toluene from a molecular similarity search. Results were further analysed using in silico molecular docking methods. The binding of toluene to two proteins, hemoglobin and serum albumin, was validated by the measurement of binding using microscale thermophoresis. The measured binding constant between toluene and hemoglobin was 1.9 [small mu ]M, while albumin demonstrated toluene-induced aggregation. These results demonstrate the applicability of an exploratory in silico toxicity tool, based on a molecular similarity search and protein-ligand docking for identification of potential targets for chemical toxins.},

abstract = {DNA demethylation plays a central role during development and in adult physiology. Different mechanisms of active DNA demethylation have been established. For example, Growth Arrest and DNA Damage 45-(GADD45) and Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET) proteins act in active DNA demethylation but their functional relationship is unresolved. Here we show that GADD45a physically interacts – and functionally cooperates with TET1 in methylcytosine (mC) processing. In reporter demethylation GADD45a requires endogenous TET1 and conversely TET1 requires GADD45a. On GADD45a target genes TET1 hyperinduces 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) in the presence of GADD45a, while 5-formyl-(fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (caC) are reduced. Likewise, in global analysis GADD45a positively regulates TET1 mediated mC oxidation and enhances fC/caC removal. Our data suggest a dual function of GADD45a in oxidative DNA demethylation, to promote directly or indirectly TET1 activity and to enhance subsequent fC/caC removal.},

abstract = {Trigger factor (TF) is the only ribosome-associated chaperone in bacteria. It interacts with hydrophobic segments in nascent chain (NCs) as they emerge from the ribosome. TF binds via its N-terminal ribosome-binding domain (RBD) mainly to ribosomal protein uL23 at the tunnel exit on the large ribosomal subunit. Whereas earlier structural data suggested that TF binds as a rigid molecule to the ribosome, recent comparisons of structural data on substrate-bound, ribosome-bound, and TF in solution from different species suggest that this chaperone is a rather flexible molecule. Here, we present two cryo-electron microscopy structures of TF bound to ribosomes translating an mRNA coding for a known TF substrate from Escherichia coli of a different length. The structures reveal distinct degrees of flexibility for the different TF domains, a conformational rearrangement of the RBD upon ribosome binding, and an increase in rigidity within TF when the NC is extended. Molecular dynamics simulations agree with these data and offer a molecular basis for these observations.},

abstract = {The entry of human immunodeficiency virus into host cells is mediated by the envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimeric spike, which consists of three exterior gp120 subunits and three transmembrane gp41 subunits. The trimeric Env undergoes extensive conformational rearrangement upon interaction with the CD4 receptor, transitioning from the unliganded, “closed” State 1 to more-open downstream State 2 and State 3 conformations. Changes in “restraining” amino acid residues, such as leucine 193 and isoleucine 423, destabilize State 1 Env, which then assumes entry-competent, downstream conformations. The introduction of an artificial disulfide bond linking the gp120 and gp41 subunits (SOS) in combination with the I559P (IP) change has allowed structural characterization of soluble gp140 (sgp140) trimers. The conformation of these SOSIP-stabilized sgp140 trimers has been suggested to represent the closed native State 1 conformation. Here we compare the impact on the membrane Env conformation of the SOSIP changes with that of the well-characterized changes (L193R and I423A) that shift Env to downstream States 2 and 3. The results presented here suggest that the SOSIP changes stabilize Env in a conformation that differs from State 1 but also from the downstream Env conformations stabilized by L193R or I423A. IMPORTANCE The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer is triggered by receptor binding to mediate the entry of the virus into cells. Most structural studies of Env trimers have utilized truncated soluble gp140 Envs stabilized with the I559P and SOS changes. Here we present evidence indicating that these stabilizing changes have a profound impact on the conformation of Env, moving Env away from the native pretriggered Env conformation. Our studies underscore the need to acquire structural information on the pretriggered Env conformation, which is recognized by most broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies.},

On the other hand, here we propose an innovative and indirect strategy for the modulation of PFKFB3 activity, achieved through allosteric bisphosphatase activation. A library of small peptides targeting an allosteric site was discovered and synthesized. The binding affinity was evaluated by microscale thermophoresis (MST). Furthermore, a LC-MS/MS analytical method for assessing the bisphosphatase activity of PFKFB3 was developed. The new method was applied for measuring the activation on bisphosphatase activity with the PFKFB3-binding peptides. The molecular mechanical connection between the newly discovered allosteric site to the bisphosphatase activity was also investigated using both experimental and computational methods.},

abstract = {Mechanistic studies in DNA repair have focused on roles of multi-protein DNA complexes, so how long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate DNA repair is less well understood. Yet, lncRNA LINP1 is over-expressed in multiple cancers and confers resistance to ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs. Here, we unveil structural and mechanistic insights into LINP1's ability to facilitate nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). We characterized LINP1 structure and flexibility and analyzed interactions with the NHEJ factor Ku70/Ku80 (Ku) and Ku complexes that direct NHEJ. LINP1 self-assembles into phase-separated condensates via RNA–RNA interactions that reorganize to form filamentous Kucontaining aggregates. Structured motifs in LINP1 bind Ku, promoting Ku multimerization and stabilization of the initial synaptic event for NHEJ. Significantly, LINP1 acts as an effective proxy for PAXX. Collective results reveal how lncRNA effectively replaces a DNA repair protein for efficient NHEJ with implications for development of resistance to cancer therapy.},

abstract = {The three tetratricopeptide repeat domain-containing docking proteins Toc64, OM64, and AtTPR7 reside in the chloroplast, mitochondrion, and endoplasmic reticulum of Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively. They are suggested to act during post-translational protein import by association with chaperone-bound preprotein complexes. Here, we performed a detailed biochemical, biophysical, and computational analysis of the interaction between Toc64, OM64, and AtTPR7 and the five cytosolic chaperones HSP70.1, HSP90.1, HSP90.2, HSP90.3, and HSP90.4. We used surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy in combination with Interaction Map{\textregistered} analysis to distinguish between chaperone oligomerization and docking protein-chaperone interactions and to calculate binding affinities for all tested interactions. Complementary to this, we applied pulldown assays as well as microscale thermophoresis as surface immobilization independent techniques. The data revealed that OM64 prefers HSP70 over HSP90, whereas Toc64 binds all chaperones with comparable affinities. We could further show that AtTPR7 is able to bind HSP90 in addition to HSP70. Moreover, differences between the HSP90 isoforms were detected and revealed a weaker binding for HSP90.1 to AtTPR7 and OM64, showing that slight differences in the amino acid composition or structure of the chaperones influence binding to the tetratricopeptide repeat domain. The combinatory approach of several methods provided a powerful toolkit to determine binding affinities of similar interaction partners in a highly quantitative manner.},

The specific detection of these protein aggregates by positron emission tomography (PET) in the patient brain can yield valuable information for diagnosis and disease progression. However, the identification of novel small compounds that bind fibrillar protein aggregates has been a challenge. In this study, microscale thermophoresis (MST) was applied to assess the binding affinity of known small molecule ligands of $\alpha$-synuclein fibrils, which were also tested in parallel in a thioflavin T fluorescence competition assay for further validation. In addition, a MST assay was also developed for the detection of the interaction between a variety of small molecules and tau fibrils. The results of this study demonstrate that MST is a powerful and practical methodology to quantify interactions between small molecules and protein fibrillar aggregates, which suggests that it can be applied for the identification and development of PET radioligands and potentially of therapeutic candidates for protein misfolding diseases.},

Ras activation is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), of which SOS1 is a major member that transduces receptor tyrosine kinase signaling to Ras. We have developed a rational approach coupling virtual screening with experimental screening in identifying small-molecule inhibitors targeting the catalytic site of SOS1 and SOS1-regulated Ras activity. A lead inhibitor, NSC-658497, was found to bind to SOS1, competitively suppress SOS1-Ras interaction, and dose-dependently inhibit SOS1 GEF activity. Mutagenesis and structure-activity relationship studies map the NSC-658497 site of action to the SOS1 catalytic site, and define the chemical moieties in the inhibitor essential for the activity. NSC-658497 showed dose-dependent efficacy in inhibiting Ras, downstream signaling activities, and associated cell proliferation. These studies establish a proof of principle for rational design of small-molecule inhibitors targeting Ras GEF enzymatic activity.},

A myosin VI construct that used this SAH domain as part of its lever arm was able to take large steps invitro but did not rescue invivo functions. It was necessary for myosin VI to internally dimerize, triggering unfolding of a three-helix bundle and calmodulin binding in order to step normally invitro and rescue endocytosis and Golgi morphology in myosin VI-null fibroblasts. A model for myosin VI emerges in which cargo binding triggers dimerization and unfolds the three-helix bundle to create a lever arm essential for invivo functions.},

abstract = {The BubR1/Bub3 complex is an important regulator of chromosome segregation as it facilitates proper kinetochore–microtubule interactions and is also an essential component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Whether BubR1/Bub3 localization to kinetochores in human cells stimulates SAC signalling or only contributes to kinetochore–microtubule interactions is debated. Here we show that two distinct pools of BubR1/Bub3 exist at kinetochores and we uncouple these with defined BubR1/Bub3 mutants to address their function. The major kinetochore pool of BubR1/Bub3 is dependent on direct Bub1/Bub3 binding and is required for chromosome alignment but not for the SAC. A distinct pool of BubR1/Bub3 localizes by directly binding to phosphorylated MELT repeats on the outer kinetochore protein KNL1. When we prevent the direct binding of BubR1/Bub3 to KNL1 the checkpoint is weakened because BubR1/Bub3 is not incorporated into checkpoint complexes efficiently. In conclusion, kinetochore localization supports both known functions of BubR1/Bub3.},

abstract = {Molecules drift along temperature gradients, an effect called thermophoresis, the Soret effect, or thermodiffusion. In liquids, its theoretical foundation is the subject of a long-standing debate. By using an all-optical microfluidic fluorescence method, we present experimental results for DNA and polystyrene beads over a large range of particle sizes, salt concentrations, and temperatures. The data support a unifying theory based on solvation entropy. Stated in simple terms, the Soret coefficient is given by the negative solvation entropy, divided by kT. The theory predicts the thermodiffusion of polystyrene beads and DNA without any free parameters. We assume a local thermodynamic equilibrium of the solvent molecules around the molecule. This assumption is fulfilled for moderate temperature gradients below a fluctuation criterion. For both DNA and polystyrene beads, thermophoretic motion changes sign at lower temperatures. This thermophilicity toward lower temperatures is attributed to an increasing positive entropy of hydration, whereas the generally dominating thermophobicity is explained by the negative entropy of ionic shielding. The understanding of thermodiffusion sets the stage for detailed probing of solvation properties of colloids and biomolecules. For example, we successfully determine the effective charge of DNA and beads over a size range that is not accessible with electrophoresis.},

abstract = {Rationale: Nanomaterials capable of specifically interacting with proteins are very important for protein storage and vaccine delivery. Supramolecular hydrogels based on peptides have emerged as promising vaccine adjuvants because of their good compatibility, ease of antigen incorporation and display, and efficiency in activating immune responses. Methods: We synthesized a self-assembling peptide (Fbp-GDFDFDYDK($\gamma$E)2-NH2, Comp. 1) serving as a supramolecular protein chaperone for protein antigen delivery. The gelation was triggered by simply mixing Comp. 1 and proteins. The vaccine adjuvant potential of Comp. 1 was demonstrated by using two protein antigens, ovalbumin (OVA) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Results: The peptide derivative Comp. 1 exhibited high protein binding capacity. Upon contacting proteins, Comp. 1 rapidly formed coassembled nanofibers/hydrogels with the proteins, which greatly delayed the release of protein antigens. Our supramolecular protein chaperone significantly stimulated specific antibody titers by assisting protein delivery to antigen-presenting cells, promoting dendritic cell (DC) maturation, prolonging antigen accumulation and retention in the lymph nodes, and eliciting the secretion of cytokines. Most importantly, our supramolecular protein chaperone strongly stimulated the cellular immune response and significantly retarded tumor growth. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated the great potential of the supramolecular protein chaperone in protein storage and delivery, vaccine production and tumor immunotherapy.},

abstract = {Microscale thermophoresis (MST) allows for quantitative analysis of protein interactions in free solution and with low sample consumption. The technique is based on thermophoresis, the directed motion of molecules in temperature gradients. Thermophoresis is highly sensitive to all types of binding-induced changes of molecular properties, be it in size, charge, hydration shell or conformation. In an all-optical approach, an infrared laser is used for local heating, and molecule mobility in the temperature gradient is analyzed via fluorescence. In standard MST one binding partner is fluorescently labeled. However, MST can also be performed label-free by exploiting intrinsic protein UV-fluorescence. Despite the high molecular weight ratio, the interaction of small molecules and peptides with proteins is readily accessible by MST. Furthermore, MST assays are highly adaptable to fit to the diverse requirements of different biomolecules, such as membrane proteins to be stabilized in solution. The type of buffer and additives can be chosen freely. Measuring is even possible in complex bioliquids like cell lysate allowing close to in vivo conditions without sample purification. Binding modes that are quantifiable via MST include dimerization, cooperativity and competition. Thus, its flexibility in assay design qualifies MST for analysis of biomolecular interactions in complex experimental settings, which we herein demonstrate by addressing typically challenging types of binding events from various fields of life science.},

abstract = {A single-subunit RNA polymerase, POLRMT, transcribes the mitochondrial genome in human cells. Recently, a factor termed as the mitochondrial transcription elongation factor, TEFM, was shown to stimulate transcription elongation in vivo, but its effect in vitro was relatively modest. In the current work, we have isolated active TEFM in recombinant form and used a reconstituted in vitro transcription system to characterize its activities. We show that TEFM strongly promotes POLRMT processivity as it dramatically stimulates the formation of longer transcripts. TEFM also abolishes premature transcription termination at conserved sequence block II, an event that has been linked to primer formation during initiation of mtDNA synthesis. We show that POLRMT pauses at a wide range of sites in a given DNA sequence. In the absence of TEFM, this leads to termination; however, the presence of TEFM abolishes this effect and aids POLRMT in continuation of transcription. Further, we show that TEFM substantially increases the POLRMT affinity to an elongation-like DNA:RNA template. In combination with previously published in vivo observations, our data establish TEFM as an essential component of the mitochondrial transcription machinery.},

Therefore, BioID was used with wild-type (WT) and oncogenic mutant (MT) H-, K-, and N-Ras, identifying known interactors, including Raf and PI3K, as well as a common set of 130 novel proteins proximal to all Ras isoforms. A CRISPR screen of these proteins for Ras dependence identifiedmTOR, whichwas alsofound proximal toMT Ras in human tumors. Oncogenic Ras directly bound two mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) components, mTOR and MAPKAP1, to promote mTORC2 kinase activity at the plasma membrane. mTORC2 enabled the Ras pro-proliferative cell cycle transcriptional program, and perturbing the Ras-mTORC2interaction impairedRas-dependent neoplasia in vivo.Combining proximity-dependent proteomics with CRISPR screening identified a new set of functional Ras-associated proteins, definedmTORC2 as a new direct Ras effector, and offers a strategy for finding new proteins that cooperate with dominant oncogenes.},

abstract = {As well known, fungi as an important biocatalysis model of glucosylation, were widely applied for bioactive compounds glucosylation mediated by the intracellular glucosytransferases (GTs). However, there is no efficient method for the real-time detection of GTs and the rapid isolation of the target fungi strains with the high expression of GTs. In the present work, we firstly developed a two-photon ratiometric fluorescent probe N-(n-butyl)-4-hydroxy-1,8-naphthalimide (NHN) for detecting the glucosyltransferases activity and intracellular imaging of GTs. Under the UV light (365 nm), the transformed product of NHN mediated by intracellular glucosyltransferase displayed blue emission to guide the rapid isolation of fungal strains possessing overexpression of GTs from the complex soil samples. Finally, by using the fluorescent probe, two target fungi were isolated and identified to be Rhizopus oryzae and Mucor circinelloides by molecular analysis, and they exhibited a robust capability to regioand stereospecific O-glycosylation. Our results fully demonstrated that NHN may be a promising tool for guiding real-time GTs activity in fungal strains, and even for developing natural fungal strains with GTs overexpression.},

abstract = {Prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP) accelerates the aggregation of $\alpha$-synuclein (aSyn), a key protein involved in development of Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. PREP inhibitors reduce aSyn aggregation but the mechanism has remained unknown. We have now used protein-fragment complementation assays (PCA) and microscale thermophoresis (MST) in parallel to show that PREP interacts directly with aSyn in both intact cells and in a cell-free system. Using split luciferase-based PCA, we first showed that PREP enhances the formation of soluble aSyn dimers in live N2A neuroblastoma cells. A PREP inhibitor, KYP-2047, reduced aSyn dimerization in PREP-expressing cells but not in cells lacking PREP expression. aSyn dimerization was also enhanced by PREP(S554A), an enzymatically inactive PREP mutant, but this was not affected by KYP-2047. PCA and MST studies showed that aSyn interacts with both PREP and PREP(S554A) with low micromolar affinity. Neither the proline-rich, C-terminal domain of aSyn or the hydrolytic activity of PREP were required for the interaction with PREP. Our results show that PREP binds directly to aSyn to enhance its dimerization, and may thus serve as a nucleation point for aSyn aggregation. Native gel analysis showed that KYP-2047 shifts PREP to a compact monomeric form with reduced ability to promote aSyn nucleation. As PREP inhibition also enhances autophagic clearance of aSyn, PREP inhibitors may reduce accumulation of aSyn inclusions via a dual mechanism, and are thus a novel therapeutic candidate for synucleinopathies. Our results also suggest that PREP has other cellular functions in addition to its peptidase activity.},

abstract = {In the fight against antimicrobial resistance, the bacterial DNA sliding clamp, $\beta$-clamp, is a promising drug target for inhibition of DNA replication and translesion synthesis. The $\beta$-clamp and its eukaryotic homolog, PCNA, share a C-terminal hydrophobic pocket where all the DNA polymerases bind. Here we report that cell penetrating peptides containing the PCNA-interacting motif APIM (APIM-peptides) inhibit bacterial growth at low concentrations in vitro, and in vivo in a bacterial skin infection model in mice. Surface plasmon resonance analysis and computer modeling suggest that APIM bind to the hydrophobic pocket on the $\beta$-clamp, and accordingly, we find that APIM-peptides inhibit bacterial DNA replication. Interestingly, at sub-lethal concentrations, APIM-peptides have anti-mutagenic activities, and this activity is increased after SOS induction. Our results show that although the sequence homology between the $\beta$-clamp and PCNA are modest, the presence of similar polymerase binding pockets in the DNA clamps allows for binding of the eukaryotic binding motif APIM to the bacterial $\beta$-clamp. Importantly, because APIM-peptides display both anti-mutagenic and growth inhibitory properties, they may have clinical potential both in combination with other antibiotics and as single agents.},

abstract = {Cyanidin, a key flavonoid that is present in red berries and other fruits, attenuates the development of several diseases, including asthma, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cancer, through its anti- inflammatory effects. We investigated the molecular basis of cyanidin action. Through a structure- based search for small molecules that inhibit signaling by the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A), we found that cyanidin specifically recognizes an IL-17A binding site in the IL-17A receptor subunit (IL-17RA) and inhibits the IL-17A/IL-17RA interaction. Experiments with mice demonstrated that cyanidin inhibited IL-17A–induced skin hyperplasia, attenuated inflammation induced by IL-17–producing T helper 17 (TH17) cells (but not that induced by TH1 or TH2 cells), and alleviated airway hyperreactivity in models of steroid-resistant and severe asthma. Our findings uncover a previously uncharacterized molecular mechanism of action of cyanidin, which may inform its further development into an effective small-molecule drug for the treatment of IL-17A–dependent inflammatory diseases and cancer.},

Sequence homology suggests similarity between NinH and Fis, a bacterial nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) involved in numerous DNA topology manipulations, including chromosome condensation, transcriptional regulation and phage site-specific recombination. We find that NinH functions as a homodimer and is able to bind and bend double-stranded DNA in vitro. Furthermore, NinH shows a preference for a 15 bp signature sequence related to the degenerate consensus favored by Fis. Structural studies reinforced the proposed similarity to Fis and supported the identification of residues involved in DNA binding which were demonstrated experimentally. Overexpression of NinH proved toxic and this correlated with its capacity to associate with DNA. NinH is the first example of a phage-encoded Fis-like NAP that likely influences phage excision-integration reactions or bacterial gene expression.},

Besides, non-photosynthetic isoforms of PEPC are found in bacteria and all types of plants, although not in animals or fungi. A single residue in the allosteric feedback inhibitor site of PEPC was shown to adjust the affinity of the photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic isoforms for feedback inhibition by metabolites of the C4 pathway. Here, we applied computational screening and biochemical analyses to identify molecules that selectively inhibit C4 PEPC, but have no effect on the activity of non-photosynthetic PEPCs. We found two types of selective inhibitors, catechins and quinoxalines.

abstract = {The Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted via a tick vector, is dependent on its tick and mammalian hosts for a number of essential nutrients. Like other bacterial diderms, it must transport these biochemicals from the extracellular milieu across two membranes, ultimately to the B. burgdorferi cytoplasm. In the current study, we established that a gene cluster comprising genes bb0215 through bb0218 is cotranscribed and is therefore an operon. Sequence analysis of these proteins suggested that they are the components of an ABC-type transporter responsible for translocating phosphate anions from the B. burgdorferi periplasm to the cytoplasm. Biophysical experiments established that the putative ligand-binding protein of this system, BbPstS (BB0215), binds to phosphate in solution. We determined the high-resolution (1.3 {\AA}) crystal structure of the protein in the absence of phosphate, revealing that the protein's fold is similar to other phosphate-binding proteins, and residues that are implicated in phosphate binding in other such proteins are conserved in BbPstS. Taken together, the gene products of bb0215-0218 function as a phosphate transporter for B. burgdorferi.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hexokinase (HK) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the first reaction of glycolysis. And Hexokinase 2 (HK2) is most closely related to malignant tumor which expresses at higher level compared with normal cells. HK2 plays a pivotal role in tumor initiation and maintenance, which provides a new target for cancer therapy. METHODS: Structure-based virtual ligand screening was used in hit identification from ZINC Drug Database. Microscale thermophoresis assay was performed to evaluate the binding affinity. Enzyme inhibition, cytotoxicity, apoptosis, intracellular ATP level, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), glucose uptake and lactate production experiments were undertaken in SW480 cells to identify Benz as a HK2 inhibitor. Western blot was used to test protein expression. SW480 cells xenograft mouse models were used for in vivo study. Nano-particles of Benz were prepared to improve the antitumor efficacy and tumor targeting of Benz. HPLC was used to measure the concentration of free Benz in tumor tissues. RESULTS: Benserazide (Benz), was identified as a selective HK2 inhibitor, could specifically bind to HK2 and significantly inhibit HK2 enzymatic activity in vitro. In addition, Benz reduced glucose uptake, lactate production and intracellular ATP level, and could cause cell apoptosis and an increased loss of MMP as well. In vivo study indicated that intraperitoneal (ip) injection of Benz at 300 and 600 mg/Kg suppressed cancer growth in tumor-bearing mice and no toxicity shown. To further improve the antitumor efficacy and tumor targeting of Benz, nano-particles of Benz was prepared. Liposomal Benz at 100 and 200 mg/Kg performed potent inhibitory effects on tumor-bearing mice, showing reduced dose and better efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a new direction for the development of Benz and its analogues as novel antitumor agents for cancer therapy.},

abstract = {Stimulation of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) triggers signaling pathways that promote the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells. Despite the pivotal function of BCR in B cell activation, the organization of the BCR on the surface of resting and antigen-activated B cells remains unclear. Here we show, using STED super-resolution microscopy, that IgMcontaining BCRs exist predominantly as monomers and dimers in the plasma membrane of resting B cells, but form higher oligomeric clusters upon stimulation. By contrast, a chronic lymphocytic leukemia-derived BCR forms dimers and oligomers in the absence of a stimulus, but a single amino acid exchange reverts its organization to monomers in unstimulated B cells. Our super-resolution microscopy approach for quantitatively analyzing cell surface proteins may thus help reveal the nanoscale organization of immunoreceptors in various cell types.},

abstract = {Protein translocation across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane is an essential process catalyzed predominantly by the Sec translocase. This system consists of the membrane-embedded protein-conducting channel SecYEG, the motor ATPase SecA, and the heterotrimeric SecDFyajC membrane protein complex. Previous studies suggest that anionic lipids are essential for SecA activity and that the N terminus of SecA is capable of penetrating the lipid bilayer. The role of lipid binding, however, has remained elusive. By employing differently sized nanodiscs reconstituted with single SecYEG complexes and comprising varying amounts of lipids, we establish that SecA gains access to the SecYEG complex via a lipid-bound intermediate state, whereas acidic phospholipids allosterically activate SecA for ATP-dependent protein translocation.},

abstract = {Both iron starvation and excess are detrimental to cellular life, especially for animal and plant pathogens since they always live in iron-limited environments produced by host immune responses. However, how organisms sense and respond to iron is incompletely understood. Herein, we reveal that in the phytopathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas cam- pestris pv. campestris, VgrS (also named ColS) is a membrane-bound receptor histidine kinase that senses extracytoplasmic iron limitation in the periplasm, while its cognate response regulator, VgrR (ColR), detects intracellular iron excess. Under iron-depleted con- ditions, dissociation of Fe3+ from the periplasmic sensor region of VgrS activates the VgrS autophosphorylation and subsequent phosphotransfer to VgrR, an OmpR-family transcrip- tion factor that regulates bacterial responses to take up iron. VgrR-VgrS regulon and the consensus DNA binding motif of the transcription factor VgrR were dissected by compara- tive proteomic and ChIP-seq analyses, which revealed that in reacting to iron-depleted envi- ronments, VgrR directly or indirectly controls the expressions of hundreds of genes that are involved in various physiological cascades, especially those associated with iron-uptake. Among them, we demonstrated that the phosphorylated VgrR tightly represses the tran- scription of a special TonB-dependent receptor gene, tdvA. This regulation is a critical pre- requisite for efficient iron uptake and bacterial virulence since activation of tdvA transcription is detrimental to these processes. When the intracellular iron accumulates, the VgrR-Fe2+ interaction dissociates not only the binding between VgrR and the tdvA promoter, but also the interaction between VgrR and VgrS. This relieves the repression in tdvA transcription to impede continuous iron uptake and avoids possible toxic effects of excessive iron accumu- lation. Our results revealed a signaling system that directly senses both extracytoplasmic and intracellular iron to modulate bacterial iron homeostasis.},

Here, we experimentally confirmed the kratagonist function of YRPs in the genus Phlebotomus. We utilized microscale thermophoresis technique to determine the amine-binding properties of YRPs in saliva of Phlebotomus perniciosus and P. orientalis, the Old-World vectors of visceral leishmaniases causative agents. Expressed and purified YRPs from three different sand fly species were tested for their interactions with various biogenic amines, including serotonin, histamine and catecholamines. Using the L. longipalpis YRP LJM11 as a control, we have demonstrated the comparability of the microscale thermophoresis method with conventional isothermal titration calorimetry described previously. By homology in silico modeling, we predicted the surface charge and both amino acids and hydrogen bonds of the amine-binding motifs to influence the binding affinities between closely related YRPs. All YRPs tested bound at least two biogenic amines, while the affinities differ both among and within species. Low affinity was observed for histamine. The salivary recombinant proteins rSP03B (P. perniciosus) and rPorASP4 (P. orientalis) showed high-affinity binding of serotonin, suggesting their capability to facilitate inhibition of the blood vessel contraction and platelet aggregation.},

Here, we present the biochemical analysis of the small subunit, Csa5, of this Cascade complex. T. tenax Csa5 preferentially bound ssDNA and mutants that showed decreased ssDNA-binding and reduced Cascade-mediated DNA cleavage were identified. Csa5 oligomerization prevented DNA binding. Specific recognition of the PAM sequence was not observed. Phylogenetic analyses identified Csa5 as a universal member of type I-A systems and revealed three distinct groups. A potential role of Csa5 in R-loop stabilization is discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract: Polysaccharides have been considered as a group of promising candidate for preventing the protein–polyphenol haze formation in beverages. In order to select effective polysaccharides to prevent the haze formation, four protein–polyphenol haze model systems were successfully established using two proteins (i.e., gelatin and bovine serum albumin) and two polyphenols (i.e., procyanidin [PC] and epigallocatechin gallate [EGCG]). Among seven common polysaccharides, 0.5 mg/mL pectin, 0.05 mg/mL xanthan gum, and 0.01 mg/mL guar gum demonstrated the maximum potential for preventing the formation of four protein–polyphenol hazes. Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry confirmed that polysaccharides affected protein–polyphenol interactions. Fluorescence spectrophotometry combined with microscale thermophoresis data indicated the relative affinities of polyphenol to protein and polysaccharide determined the mechanism of polysaccharide for preventing the haze formation. In bovine serum albumin (BSA)/gelatin-EGCG system, polysaccharides (pectin, xanthan gum and guar gum) competed with BSA/gelatin to bind EGCG for prevention the formation of BSA/gelatin-EGCG haze. However, in BSA/gelatin-PC system, polysaccharides (pectin, xanthan gum, and guar gum) formed a ternary complex (protein–tannin–polysaccharide) for increasing the solubility of protein-polyphenol aggregation. From apple juice results, the reduction rates of guar gum in two apple juice systems (gelatin-PC, BSA-PC) were 21{\%} and 56{\%} within 8 weeks, indicating guar gum might be the most effective polysaccharide in preventing the haze formation. Practical Application: This experiment data could be used for development of polysaccharide products for prevention of protein–polyphenol haze formation in beverages.},

We describe here the synthesis and testing of potential small-molecule pan-RAS ligands, which were designed to interact with adjacent sites on the surface of oncogenic KRAS. One compound, termed 3144, was found to bind to RAS proteins using microscale thermophoresis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry and to exhibit lethality in cells partially dependent on expression of RAS proteins. This compound was metabolically stable in liver microsomes and displayed anti-tumor activity in xenograft mouse cancer models. These findings suggest that pan-RAS inhibition may be an effective therapeutic strategy for some cancers and that structure-based design of small molecules targeting multiple adjacent sites to create multivalent inhibitors may be effective for some proteins.},

abstract = {The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) constitutes a focal element in the adaptive immune response against infected or malignantly transformed cells. TAP shuttles proteasomal degradation products into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum for loading of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Here, the heterodimeric TAP complex was purified and reconstituted in nanodiscs in defined stoichiometry. We demonstrate that a single heterodimeric core-TAP complex is active in peptide binding, which is tightly coupled to ATP hydrolysis. Notably, with increasing peptide length, the ATP turnover was gradually decreased, revealing that ATP hydrolysis is coupled to the movement of peptide through the ATP-binding cassette transporter. In addition, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations show that the observed 22 lipids are sufficient to form an annular belt surrounding the TAP complex. This lipid belt is essential for high affinity inhibition by the herpesvirus immune evasin ICP47. In conclusion, nanodiscs are a powerful approach to study the important role of lipids as well as the function, interaction, and modulation of the antigen translocation machinery.},

abstract = {The ubiquitylation signal promotes trafficking of endogenous and retroviral transmembrane proteins. The signal is decoded by a large set of ubiquitin (Ub) receptors that tether Ub-binding domains (UBDs) to the trafficking machinery. We developed a structure-based procedure to scan the protein data bank for hidden UBDs. The screen retrieved many of the known UBDs. Intriguingly, new potential UBDs were identified, including the ALIX-V domain. Pull-down, cross-linking and E3-independent ubiquitylation assays biochemically corroborated the in silico findings. Guided by the output model, we designed mutations at the postulated ALIX-V:Ub interface. Biophysical affinity measurements using microscale-thermophoresis of wild-type and mutant proteins revealed some of the interacting residues of the complex. ALIX-V binds mono-Ub with a K(d) of 119 muM. We show that ALIX-V oligomerizes with a Hill coefficient of 5.4 and IC(50) of 27.6 muM and that mono-Ub induces ALIX-V oligomerization. Moreover, we show that ALIX-V preferentially binds K63 di-Ub compared with mono-Ub and K48 di-Ub. Finally, an in vivo functionality assay demonstrates the significance of ALIX-V:Ub interaction in equine infectious anaemia virus budding. These results not only validate the new procedure, but also demonstrate that ALIX-V directly interacts with Ub in vivo and that this interaction can influence retroviral budding.},

The interactions between small molecules and telomeric G-quadruplexes were also evaluated in the different systems.

The pathway can be regulated by feedback inhibition of DHDPS through the allosteric binding of the end product, lysine. The current dogma states that DHDPS from Gram-negative bacteria are inhibited by lysine but orthologs from Gram-positive species are not. The 1.65-A resolution structure of the Gram-negative Legionella pneumophila DHDPS and the 1.88-A resolution structure of the Gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae DHDPS bound to lysine, together with comprehensive functional analyses, show that this dogma is incorrect. We subsequently employed our crystallographic data with bioinformatics, mutagenesis, enzyme kinetics, and microscale thermophoresis to reveal that lysine-mediated inhibition is not defined by Gram staining, but by the presence of a His or Glu at position 56 (Escherichia coli numbering). This study has unveiled the molecular determinants defining lysine-mediated allosteric inhibition of bacterial DHDPS.},

Here we report the crystal structure of a Fab-Abeta peptide complex that reveals Bapineuzumab surprisingly captures Abeta in a monomeric helical conformation at the N-terminus. Microscale thermophoresis suggests that the Fab binds soluble Abeta(1-40) with a K(D) of 89 (+/-9) nM. The structure explains the antibody's exquisite selectivity for particular Abeta species and why it cannot recognize N-terminally modified or truncated Abeta peptides.},

The high genetic variability ofHCV and the rapid development of drug-resistant strains are driving the urgent search for new direct-acting antiviral agents. A new class of agents has recently been developed that are believed to target the HCV protein NS5A although precisely where they interact and how they affect function is unknown. Here we describe an invitro assay based on microscale thermophoresis and demonstrate that two clinically relevant inhibitors bind tightly to NS5A domain 1 and inhibit RNA binding. Conversely, RNA binding inhibits compound binding. The compounds bind more weakly to known resistance mutants L31V and Y93H. The compounds do not affect NS5A dimerisation. We propose that current NS5A inhibitors act by favouring a dimeric structure of NS5A that does not bind RNA.},

abstract = {The AT-hook has been defined as a DNA binding peptide motif that contains a glycine-arginine-proline (G-R-P) tripeptide core flanked by basic amino acids. Recent reports documented variations in the sequence of AT-hooks and revealed RNA binding activity of some canonical AT-hooks, suggesting a higher structural and functional variability of this protein domain than previously anticipated. Here we describe the discovery and characterization of the extended AT-hook peptide motif (eAT-hook), in which basic amino acids appear symmetrical mainly at a distance of 12-15 amino acids from the G-R-P core. We identified 80 human and 60 mouse eAT-hook proteins and biochemically characterized the eAT-hooks of Tip5/BAZ2A, PTOV1 and GPBP1. Microscale thermophoresis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays reveal the nucleic acid binding features of this peptide motif, and show that eAT-hooks bind RNA with one order of magnitude higher affinity than DNA. In addition, cellular localization studies suggest a role for the N-terminal eAT-hook of PTOV1 in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. In summary, our findings classify the eAT-hook as a novel nucleic acid binding motif, which potentially mediates various RNA-dependent cellular processes.},

abstract = {CXCL14, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 14, is a novel highly conserved chemokine with unique features. Despite exhibiting the typical chemokine fold, it has a very short N-terminus of just two amino acid residues responsible for chemokine receptor activation. CXCL14 actively participates in homeostatic immune surveillance of skin and mucosae, is linked to metabolic disorders, fibrotic lung diseases, and possesses strong anti-angiogenic properties in early tumor development. In this work, we investigated the interaction of CXCL14 with various glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) by NMR spectroscopy, microscale thermophoresis, analytical heparin affinity chromatography, and in silico approaches to understand the molecular basis of GAG-binding. We observed different GAG binding modes specific for the GAG type used in the study. In particular, the CXCL14 epitope for heparin suggests a binding pose distinguishable from the ones of the other GAGs investigated (hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate-A/C, -D, dermatan sulfate. This observation is also supported by computational methods that included molecular docking, molecular dynamics and free energy calculations. Based on our results, we suggest that distinct GAG sulfation patterns confer specificity beyond simple electrostatic interactions usually considered to represent the driving forces in protein-GAG interactions. The CXCL14-GAG system represents a promising approach to investigate the specificity of GAG protein interactions, which represents an important topic for developing the rational approaches to novel strategies in regenerative medicine.},

abstract = {During host colonization, bacteria use the alarmones (p)ppGpp to reshape their proteome by acting pleiotropically on DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. Here, we elucidate how the initiating ribosome senses the cellular pool of guanosine nucleotides and regulates the progression towards protein synthesis. Our results show that the affinity of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and the inhibitory concentration of ppGpp for the 30S-bound initiation factor IF2 vary depending on the programmed mRNA. The TufA mRNA enhanced GTP affinity for 30S complexes, resulting in improved ppGpp tolerance and allowing efficient protein synthesis. Conversely, the InfA mRNA allowed ppGpp to compete with GTP for IF2, thus stalling 30S complexes. Structural modeling and biochemical analysis of the TufA mRNA unveiled a structured enhancer of translation initiation (SETI) composed of two consecutive hairpins proximal to the translation initiation region (TIR) that largely account for ppGpp tolerance under physiological concentrations of guanosine nucleotides. Furthermore, our results show that the mechanism enhancing ppGpp tolerance is not restricted to the TufA mRNA, as similar ppGpp tolerance was found for the SETI-containing Rnr mRNA. Finally, we show that IF2 can use pppGpp to promote the formation of 30S initiation complexes (ICs), albeit requiring higher factor concentration and resulting in slower transitions to translation elongation. Altogether, our data unveil a novel regulatory mechanism at the onset of protein synthesis that tolerates physiological concentrations of ppGpp and that bacteria can exploit to modulate their proteome as a function of the nutritional shift happening during stringent response and infection.},

abstract = {Chemical denaturant titrations can be used to accurately determine protein stability. However, data acquisition is typically labour intensive, has low throughput and is difficult to automate. These factors, combined with high protein consumption, have limited the adoption of chemical denaturant titrations in commercial settings. Thermal denaturation assays can be automated, sometimes with very high throughput. However, thermal denaturation assays are incompatible with proteins that aggregate at high temperatures and large extrapolation of stability parameters to physiological temperatures can introduce significant uncertainties.We used capillary-based instruments to measure chemical denaturant titrations by intrinsic fluorescence and microscale thermophoresis. This allowed higher throughput, consumed several hundred-fold less protein than conventional, cuvette-based methods yet maintained the high quality of the conventional approaches.We also established efficient strategies for automated, direct determination of protein stability at a range of temperatures via chemical denaturation, which has utility for characterising stability for proteins that are difficult to purify in high yield. This approach may also have merit for proteins that irreversibly denature or aggregate in classical thermal denaturation assays. We also developed procedures for affinity ranking of protein–ligand interactions from ligand-induced changes in chemical denaturation data, and proved the principle for this by correctly ranking the affinity of previously unreported peptide–PDZ domain interactions. The increased throughput, automation and low protein consumption of protein stability determinations afforded by using capillary-based methods to measure denaturant titrations, can help to revolutionise protein research. We believe that the strategies reported are likely to find wide applications in academia, biotherapeutic formulation and drug discovery programmes.},

They have multiple important functions including the regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1). The human isoforms CHP1 and CHP2 share high sequence similarity, but have distinct expression profiles with CHP2 levels for instance increased in malignant cells. These CHPs bind Ca2+ with high affinity. Biochemical data indicated that Ca2+ can regulate their functions. Experimental evidence for Ca2+-modulated structural changes was lacking. With a newly established fluorescent probe hydrophobicity (FPH) assay, we detected Ca2+-induced conformational changes in both CHPs. These changes are in line with an opening of their hydrophobic pocket that binds the CHP-binding region (CBD) of NHE1. Whereas the pocket is closed in the absence of Ca2+ in CHP2, it is still accessible for the dye in CHP1. Both CHPs interacted with CBD in the presence and absence of Ca2+. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis revealed high binding affinity for both CHPs to CBD with equilibrium dissociation constants (KDs) in the nanomolar range. The KD for CHP1:CBD was not affected by Ca2+, whereas Ca2+-depletion increased the KD 7-fold for CHP2:CBD showing a decreased affinity. The data indicate an isoform specific regulatory interaction of CHP1 and CHP2 with NHE1.},

abstract = {Pandemic HIV-1 (group M) emerged following the cross-species transmission of a simian immunodeficiency virus from chimpanzees (SIVcpz) to humans. Primate lentiviruses (HIV/SIV) require the T cell receptor CD4 to enter into target cells. By surveying the sequence and function of CD4 in 50 chimpanzee individuals, we find that all chimpanzee CD4 alleles encode a fixed, chimpanzee-specific substitution (34T) that creates a glycosylation site on the virus binding surface of the CD4 receptor. Additionally, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has arisen in chimpanzee CD4 (68T) that creates a second glycosylation site on the same virus-binding interface. This substitution is not yet fixed, but instead alleles containing this SNP are still circulating within chimpanzee populations. Thus, all allelic versions of chimpanzee CD4 are singly glycosylated at the virus binding surface, and some allelic versions are doubly glycosylated. Doubly glycosylated forms of chimpanzee CD4 reduce HIV-1 and SIVcpz infection by as much as two orders of magnitude. Full restoration of virus infection in cells bearing chimpanzee CD4 requires reversion of both threonines at sites 34 and 68, destroying both of the glycosylation sites, suggesting that the effects of the glycans are additive. Differentially glycosylated CD4 receptors were biochemically purified and used in neutralization assays and microscale thermophoresis to show that the glycans on chimpanzee CD4 reduce binding affinity with the lentiviral surface glycoprotein, Env. These glycans create a shield that protects CD4 from being engaged by viruses, demonstrating a powerful form of host resistance against deadly primate lentiviruses.},

Their extracellular loops (ECLs) are assumed to control paracellular permeability and are targets of pathogenes. We demonstrated that claudin-1 is crucial for paracellular tightening. Its ECL1 is essential for the sealing and contains two cysteines conserved throughout all claudins.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAIMS: We prove the hypothesis that this cysteine motif forms a redox-sensitive intramolecular disulfide bridge and, hence, the claudin-1-ECL1 constitutes a functional structure which is associated to ECLs of this and other TJ proteins.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The structure and function of claudin-1-ECL1 was elucidated by investigating sequences of this ECL as synthetic peptides, C1C2, and as recombinant proteins, and exhibited a $\beta$-sheet binding surface flanked by an $\alpha$-helix. These sequences bound to different claudins, their ECL1, and peptides with nanomolar binding constants. C-terminally truncated C1C2 (-4aaC) opened cellular barriers and the perineurium. Recombinant ECL1 formed oligomers, and bound to claudin-1 expressing cells. Oligomerization and claudin association were abolished by reducing agents, indicating intraloop disulfide bridging and redox sensitivity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINNOVATION: The structural and functional model based on our in vitro and in vivo investigations suggested that claudin-1-ECL1 constitutes a functional and ECL-binding $\beta$-sheet, stabilized by a shielded and redox-sensitive disulfide bond.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Since the $\beta$-sheet represents a consensus sequence of claudins and further junctional proteins, a general structural feature is implied. Therefore, our model is of general relevance for the TJ assembly in normal and pathological conditions. C1C2-4aaC is a new drug enhancer that is used to improve pharmacological treatment through tissue barriers.},

abstract = {Epigenetic regulation is based on specific molecular interactions between epigenetic reader, writer and eraser molecules and chromatin. Binding parameters of these interactions such as binding affinities, stoichiometries and thermodynamics are essential for the understanding of the establishment and maintenance of epigenetic networks. The MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) is a rapid and precise method to characterize epigenetic interactions in solution at microliter scale, requiring low concentrations of the potential interactors. The technology is based on the movement of molecules through temperature gradients, a physical effect referred to as thermophoresis. The thermophoretic movement of a molecule depends on its size, charge and hydration shell. Upon the interaction of two molecules, at least one of these parameters is altered, leading to a change in the movement behavior, which can be used to quantify molecular interactions. MST offers free choice of buffers, also allowing measurements in serum and crude extracts, thereby ensuring optimal reaction conditions. Binding affinities from pM to mM can be measured, perfectly suited to analyze protein/protein, protein/modified peptide and protein/nucleic acid interactions in epigenetics. This review demonstrates the potential of this rapid and versatile technology in the characterization of epigenetic modifiers.},

abstract = {The exocyst complex regulates the last steps of exocytosis, which is essential to organisms across kingdoms. In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. Investigation of the dynamic regulation of the evolutionarily conserved exocyst-related processes using mutants in genetically tractable organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. An EXO70 protein with a C-terminal truncation results in dominant ES2 resistance, uncovering possible distinct regulatory roles for the N terminus of the protein. This study not only provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation but also offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease.},

abstract = {Anthracyclines like daunorubicin (DRN) and doxorubicin (DOX) play an undisputed key role in cancer treatment, but their chronic administration can cause severe side effects. For precise anthracycline analytical systems, aptamers are preferable recognition elements. Here, we describe the detailed characterisation of a single-stranded DNA aptamer DRN-10 and its truncated versions for DOX and DRN detection. Binding affinities were determined from surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and microscale thermophoresis (MST) and combined with conformational data from circular dichroism (CD). Both aptamers displayed similar nanomolar binding affinities to DRN and DOX, even though their rate constants differed as shown by SPR recordings. SPR kinetic data unravelled a two-state reaction model including a 1:1 binding and a subsequent conformational change of the binding complex. This model was supported by CD spectra. In addition, the dissociation constants determined with MST were always lower than that from SPR, and especially for the truncated aptamer they differed by two orders of magnitude. This most probably reflects the methodological difference, namely labelling for MST vs. immobilisation for SPR. From CD recordings, we suggested a specific G-quadruplex as structural basis for anthracycline binding. We concluded that the aptamer DRN-10 is a promising recognition element for anthracycline detection systems and further selected aptamers can be also characterised with the combined methodological approach presented here.},

abstract = {Ras proteins are small GTPases that act as signal transducers between cell surface receptors and several intracellular signaling cascades. They contain highly homologous catalytic domains and flexible C-terminal hypervariable regions (HVRs) that differ across Ras isoforms. KRAS is among the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human tumors. Surprisingly, we found that the C-terminal HVR of K-Ras4B, thought to minimally impact the catalytic domain, directly interacts with the active site of the protein. The interaction is almost 100-fold tighter with the GDP-bound than the GTP-bound protein. HVR binding interferes with Ras-Raf interaction, modulates binding to phospholipids, and slightly slows down nucleotide exchange. The data indicate that contrary to previously suggested models of K-Ras4B signaling, HVR plays essential roles in regulation of signaling. High affinity binding of short peptide analogs of HVR to K-Ras active site suggests that targeting this surface with inhibitory synthetic molecules for the therapy of KRAS-dependent tumors is feasible.},

abstract = {Viral genomic RNA is packaged into virions with high specificity and selectivity. However, in vitro the Gag specificity towards viral RNA is obscured when measured in buffers containing physiological salt. Interestingly, when the binding is challenged by increased salt concentration, the addition of competing RNAs, or introducing mutations to Gag protein, the specificity towards viral RNA becomes detectable. The objective of this work was to examine the contributions of the individual HIV-1 Gag polyprotein domains to nonspecific and specific RNA binding and stability of the initial protein-RNA complexes. Using a panel of Gag proteins with mutations disabling different Gag-Gag or Gag-RNA interfaces, we investigated the distinct contributions of individual domains which distinguish the binding to viral and nonviral RNA by measuring the binding of the proteins to RNAs. We measured the binding affinity in near-physiological salt concentration, and then challenged the binding by increasing the ionic strength to suppress the electrostatic interactions and reveal the contribution of specific Gag-RNA and Gag-Gag interactions. Surprisingly, we observed that Gag dimerization and the highly basic region in the matrix domain contribute significantly to the specificity of viral RNA binding.},

abstract = {The RNA-programmable DNA-endonuclease Cas9 is widely used for genome engineering, where a high degree of specificity is required. To investigate which features of Cas9 determine the sensitivity to mismatches along the target DNA, we performed in vitro biochemical assays and bacterial survival assays in Escherichia coli. We demonstrate that arginines in the Cas9 bridge helix influence guide RNA, and target DNA binding and cleavage. They cluster in two groups that either increase or decrease the Cas9 sensitivity to mismatches. We show that the bridge helix is essential for R-loop formation and that R63 and R66 reduce Cas9 specificity by stabilizing the R-loop in the presence of mismatches. Additionally, we identify Q768 that reduces sensitivity of Cas9 to protospacer adjacent motif-distal mismatches. The Cas9{\_}R63A/Q768A variant showed increased specificity in human cells. Our results provide a firm basis for function- and structure-guided mutagenesis to increase Cas9 specificity for genome engineering.},

abstract = {Scaffold proteins tether and orient components of a signaling cascade to facilitate signaling. Although much is known about how scaffolds colocalize signaling proteins, it is unclear whether scaffolds promote signal amplification. Here, we used arrestin-3, a scaffold of the ASK1- MKK4/7-JNK3 cascade, as a model to understand signal amplification by a scaffold protein. We found that arrestin-3 exhibited {\textgreater}15-fold higher affinity for inactive JNK3 than for active JNK3, and this change involved a shift in the binding site following JNK3 activation. We used systems biochemistry modeling and Bayesian inference to evaluate how the activation of upstream kinases contributed to JNK3 phosphorylation. Our combined experimental and computational approach suggested that the catalytic phosphorylation rate of JNK3 at Thr-221 by MKK7 is two orders of magnitude faster than the corresponding phosphorylation of Tyr-223 by MKK4 with or without arrestin-3. Finally, we showed that the release of activated JNK3 was critical for signal amplification. Collectively, our data suggest a “conveyor belt” mechanism for signal amplification by scaffold proteins. This mechanism informs on a long-standing mystery for how few upstream kinase molecules activate numerous downstream kinases to amplify signaling.},

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-specific antibodymodified FcBP-NPs (HER2/FcBP-NPs) showed 5.3-fold higher binding affinity to HER2 than isotype IgG antibody-modified NPs, and 2.6-fold higher affinity compared with HER2 antibody-conjugated Mal-NPs. Cellular uptake of HER2/FcBP-NPs in HER2-positive cells was significantly higher than that of other formulations. The biodistribution of HER2/FcBPNPs was higher than that of antibody-conjugated NPs in HER2-positive tumor tissues, but not in HER2-negative tumors. Our findings suggest the potential of bacteriomimetic nanoparticles for controlling the orientation of antibody attachment. These nanoparticles may have diverse applications in nanomedicine, including drug delivery, molecular imaging, and diagnosis.},

abstract = {Complement activation plays a major role in many acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. C3d, a terminal product of complement activation, remains covalently attached to cells and is an excellent biomarker of complement-mediated inflammation. We employed a virtual high-throughput screening protocol to identify molecules with predicted binding to complement C3d and with intrinsic fluorescence properties to enable detection. Pharmacophore models were developed based on known C3d-ligand interactions and information from computational analysis of structural and molecular dynamics data. Iterative pharmacophore-based virtual screening was performed to identify druglike molecules with physicochemical similarity to the natural C3d ligand CR2. Hits from the pharmacophore screens were docked to C3d and ranked based on predicted binding free energies. Top-ranked molecules were selected for experimental validation of binding affinity to C3d, using microscale thermophoresis, and for their suitability to become molecular imaging agents, using fluorescence spectroscopy. This work serves as a foundation for identifying additional fluorescent molecules with high-affinity for C3d that will subsequently be explored as noninvasive in vivo diagnostics of complement-mediated inflammation, for spatiotemporal monitoring of disease progression, and for targeting therapeutics to sites of inflammation.},

(2014) Nucleic Acids Res., 42, 860–869; Hoffmann R.F. et al. (2016) Nu- cleic Acids Res., 44, 152–163). It was shown that 1H6 strongly stains nuclei and has exquisite speci- ficity for heterochromatin by immuno-electron mi- croscopy. Here we extend our studies of 1H6 re- activity using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and microscale thermophoresis (MST). As previously reported, 1H6 was found to strongly bind intermolecular G4 structures with a (T4G4)2 sequence motif. However, using both methods we did not de- tect significant binding to G4 structures without thymidines in their sequence motif or to G4 struc- turesmadewith(T2G4)2 oligonucleotides. In addi- tion, we observed strong, sequence-specific bind- ing of 1H6 by ELISA to immobilized single stranded poly(T) DNA but not to immobilized poly(C) or poly(A) homo-polymers. Cross-reactivity of 1H6 to poly(T) was not measured in solution using MST. 1H6 was furthermore found to bind to selected areas on DNA fibers but only after DNA denaturation. Based on these observations we propose that 1H6 binds with high affinity to adjacent T's that are restricted in their movement in selected G4 structures and denatured DNA. Cross-reactivity of 1H6 to immobilized single stranded T-rich DNA next to its previously reported specificity for bona fide G4 structures needs to be taken into account in the interpretation of 1H6 bind- ing to (sub-) cellular structures.},

abstract = {Formation of Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein inclusions within motor neurons is one of the principal characteristics of SOD1-related amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A hypothesis as to the nature of SOD1 aggregation implicates oxidative damage to a solvent-exposed tryptophan as causative. Here, we chart the discovery of a phenanthridinone based compound (Lig9) from the NCI Diversity Set III by rational methods by in silico screening and crystallographic validation. The crystal structure of the complex with SOD1, refined to 2.5 {\AA}, revealed that Lig9 binds the SOD1 b-barrel in the b-strand 2 and 3 region which is known to scaffold SOD1 fibrillation. The phenanthridinone moiety makes a substantial p–p interaction with Trp32 of SOD1. The compound possesses a significant binding affinity for SOD1 and inhibits oxidation of Trp32; a critical residue for SOD1 aggregation. Thus, Lig9 is a good candidate from which to develop a new library of SOD1 aggregation inhibitors through protection of Trp32 oxidation.},

abstract = {Efficient selection of nucleic acid aptamers with high affinity and specificity for a broad range of targets remains challenging. Historically, aptamer selections have been protracted and tedious processes, often requiring double-digit rounds of selection to converge nucleic acid pools into a small number of prospective high-affinity aptamers. More recently, the use of microfluidic devices and specialized equipment has helped streamline the aptamer selection process, but these platforms are not necessarily accessible to the broad research community. Here, we demonstrate that aptamers with high affinity and moderate specificity can be obtained with a conventional selection workflow that ismodified to include facilemethods for increasing partitioning and enhancing selection stringency. This process exposes an immobilized protein target to a single-stranded DNA library, followed by washing with buffer that contains the undesired off-target(s), with both steps occurring under constant perfusion using a standard peristaltic pump. Prospective aptamers are then eluted, amplified by an emulsion polymerase chain reaction, regenerated to single strands by enzymatic digestion, and resubjected to the selection procedure.We validated this selection scheme using the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family, wherebywe successfully isolated nanomolar affinity aptamers against PDGF-BB with specifi},

abstract = {The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protein negative factor (Nef) is important for AIDS pathogenesis. An anti-Nef single-domain antibody (sdAb19) derived from camelids has been previously generated and shown to effectively block the physiological functions of Nef in vitro and in vivo in nef-transgenic mice. However, sdAb19 must be ectopically expressed within the target cell to be able to exert its neutralizing effect on Nef, while the extra-cellular administration method turned out to be ineffective. This might suggest a default of the stability or/and deliverability of sdAb19. The identification of small molecule compounds capable of inhibiting the Nef-sdAb19 interaction and mimicking the neutralizing activity of sdAb19 in vivo would therefore be the means of circumventing the problem encountered with sdAb19. Here we describe the development of a high-throughput screening method combining the homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) and the microscale thermophoresis (MST) techniques for the identification of small-molecule compounds inhibiting the Nef-sdAb19 interaction by binding to Nef protein. Eight small-molecule compounds have been selected for their ability to significantly inhibit the Nef-sdAb19 interaction and to bind to Nef. These molecules could be further assessed for their potential of being the Nef-neutralizing agents in the future.},

abstract = {MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) is a powerful technique to quantify biomolecular interactions. It is based on thermophoresis, the directed movement of molecules in a temperature gradient, which strongly depends on a variety of molecular properties such as size, charge, hydration shell or conformation. Thus, this technique is highly sensitive to virtually any change in molecular properties, allowing for a precise quantification of molecular events independent of the size or nature of the investigated specimen. During a MST experiment, a temperature gradient is induced by an infrared laser. The directed movement of molecules through the temperature gradient is detected and quantified using either covalently attached or intrinsic fluorophores. By combining the precision of fluorescence detection with the variability and sensitivity of thermophoresis, MST provides a flexible, robust and fast way to dissect molecular interactions. In this review, we present recent progress and developments in MST technology and focus on MST applications beyond standard biomolecular interaction studies. By using different model systems, we introduce alternative MST applications - such as determination of binding stoichiometries and binding modes, analysis of protein unfolding, thermodynamics and enzyme kinetics - and also demonstrate the capability of MST to quantify high-affinity interactions with dissociation constants (Kds) in the low picomolar (pM) range as well as protein-protein interactions in pure mammalian cell lysates.},

abstract = {Inorganic phosphate (Pi)–sensing is a key application in many disciplines, and biosensors emerged as powerful analytic tools for use in environmental Pi monitoring, food quality control, basic research, and medical diagnosis. Current sensing techniques exploit either electrochemical or optical detection approaches for Pi quantification. Here, by combining the advantages of a biological Pi–receptor based on the bacterial phosphate binding protein with the principle of thermophoresis, i.e. the diffusional motion of particles in response to a temperature gradient, we developed a continuous, sensitive, and versatile method for detecting and quantifying free Pi in the subnanomolar to micromolar range in sample volumes ≤10 $\mu$L. By recording entropy–driven changes in the directed net diffusional flux of the Pi–sensor in a temperature gradient at defined time intervals, we validate the method for analyzing steady–state enzymatic reactions associated with Pi liberation in real–time for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) turnover by myosin, the actomyosin system and for insoluble, high molecular weight enzyme–protein assemblies in biopsy derived myofibrils. Particular features of the method are: (1) high Pi–sensitivity and selectivity, (2) uncoupling of the read–out signal from potential chemical and spectroscopic interferences, (3) minimal sample volumes and nanogram protein amounts, (4) possibility to run several experiments in parallel, and (5) straightforward data analysis. The present work establishes thermophoresis as powerful sensing method in microscale format for a wide range of applications, augmenting the current set of detection principles in biosensor technology.},

Previous studies have suggested a link between tRNA aminoacylation and high-molecular-weight cellular complexes such as the cytoskeleton or ribosomes. However, the structural basis of these interactions and potential mechanistic implications are not well understood. To biochemically characterize these interactions we have used a system of two interacting archaeal aaRSs: an atypical methanogenic-type seryl-tRNA synthetase and an archaeal ArgRS. More specifically, we have shown by thermophoresis and surface plasmon resonance that these two aaRSs bind to the large ribosomal subunit with micromolar affinities. We have identified the L7/L12 stalk and the proteins located near the stalk base as the main sites for aaRS binding. Finally, we have performed a bioinformatics analysis of synonymous codons in the Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus genome that supports a mechanism in which the deacylated tRNAs may be recharged by aaRSs bound to the ribosome and reused at the next occurrence of a codon encoding the same amino acid. These results suggest a mechanism of tRNA recycling in which aaRSs associate with the L7/L12 stalk region to recapture the tRNAs released from the preceding ribosome in polysomes.},

In this study, we examined the effects and mechanisms of an arabinoglucan (AG) isolated from Angelica sinensis on DN, which was induced in rats by streptozotocin. The rats were intraperitoneally treated with AG for 8 weeks. Diabetic rats exhibited renal dysfunction, as evidenced by reduced creatinine clearance, increased blood urea nitrogen and proteinuria, along with marked enhanced mesangial expansion. All of these abnormalities were reversed by the AG. Overproliferation of glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) was halted by AG treatment, and inflammation mediators were attenuated. Furthermore, the AG significantly inhibited the expression of nuclear factor‐$\kappa$B (NF‐$\kappa$B) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), both in diabetic kidneys and in high glucose‐induced GMCs. Using an NF‐$\kappa$B inhibitor, RAGE siRNA and RAGE‐overexpressing plasmid, we further demonstrated that the AG inhibited GMC viability mediated by RAGE/NF‐$\kappa$B signaling pathway. More importantly, we show that the AG can directly interact with RAGE and disrupt RAGE binding to advanced glycation end products using microscale thermophoresis. These findings suggest that this AG, acting as a RAGE antagonist, is a promising agent for the prevention and treatment of DN.},

abstract = {Background Proper spindle assembly and chromosome segregation rely on precise microtubule dynamics, which are governed in part by the kinesin-13 MCAK. MCAK microtubule depolymerization activity is inhibited by Aurora B-dependent phosphorylation, but the mechanism of this inhibition is not understood. Results Here, we develop the first F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensor for MCAK and show that MCAK in solution exists in a closed conformation mediated by an interaction between the C-terminal domain (CT) and the neck. Using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) we show that MCAK bound to microtubule ends is closed relative to MCAK associated with the microtubule lattice. Aurora B phosphorylation at S196 in the neck opens MCAK conformation and diminishes the interaction between the CT and the neck. Using FLIM and TIRF imaging, we find that changes in MCAK conformation are associated with a decrease in MCAK affinity for the microtubule. Conclusions Unlike motile kinesins, which are open when doing work, the high-affinity binding state for microtubule-depolymerizing kinesins is in a closed conformation. Phosphorylation switches MCAK conformation, which inhibits its ability to interact with microtubules and reduces its microtubule depolymerization activity. This work shows that the conformational model proposed for regulating kinesin activity is not universal and that microtubule-depolymerizing kinesins utilize a distinct conformational mode to regulate affinity for the microtubule, thus controlling their catalytic efficiency. Furthermore, our work provides a mechanism by which the robust microtubule depolymerization activity of kinesin-13s can be rapidly modulated to control cellular microtubule dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The packaging of DNA into nucleosomes and the organisation into higher order structures of chromatin limits the access of sequence specific DNA binding factors to DNA. In cells, DNA methylation is preferentially occuring in the linker region of nucleosomes, suggesting a structural impact of chromatin on DNA methylation. These observations raise the question whether DNA methyltransferases are capable to recognize the nucleosomal substrates and to modify the packaged DNA. Here, we performed a detailed analysis of nucleosome binding and nucleosomal DNA methylation by the maintenance DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1. Our binding studies show that Dnmt1 has a DNA length sensing activity, binding cooperatively to DNA, and requiring a minimal DNA length of 20 bp. Dnmt1 needs linker DNA to bind to nucleosomes and most efficiently recognizes nucleosomes with symmetric DNA linkers. Footprinting experiments reveal that Dnmt1 binds to both DNA linkers exiting the nucleosome core. The binding pattern correlates with the efficient methylation of DNA linkers. However, the enzyme lacks the ability to methylate nucleosomal CpG sites on mononucleosomes and nucleosomal arrays, unless chromatin remodeling enzymes create a dynamic chromatin state. In addition, our results show that Dnmt1 functionally interacts with specific chromatin remodeling enzymes to enable complete methylation of hemi-methylated DNA in chromatin.},

abstract = {TheMycobacteriumtuberculosis (Mtb) Rv2747 gene encodes for a functional protein known as ArgA,which plays an important role in the first step of the L-arginine biosynthesis pathway. ArgA transfers the acetyl group fromthe acetyl-CoA to either L-glutamate or L-glutamine, which are the known substrates. Here, we present two crystal structures of ArgA: one complexed with CoA and product bound N-acetylglutamine and the other complexed with acetyl-CoA and the inhibitor L-arginine at 2.3 and 3.0 {\AA} resolution respectively. The Mtb ArgA protomer was found to have a “V” cleft and a “$\beta$” bulge, archetypal of a classical GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase superfamily of proteins. The product bound form implies that ArgA can also acetylate L-glutamine like L-glutamate. The active site is strongly inhibited by L-arginine resulting in a closed conformation of ArgA and both Larginine and N-acetylglutamine were found to occupy at the same active site. Together with structural analysis, molecular docking studies, microscale thermophoresis and enzyme inhibition assays, we conclude that L-glutamine, L-glutamate and L-arginine, all occupy at the same active site of ArgA. Furthermore in case of Mtb ArgA, L-arginine does not act as an allosteric inhibitor unlike other N-acetylglutamate synthase family of proteins.},

abstract = {The potent antiretroviral protein APOBEC3G (A3G) specifically targets and deaminates deoxycytidine nucleotides, generating deoxyuridine, in single stranded DNA (ssDNA) intermediates produced during HIV replication. A non-catalytic domain in A3G binds strongly to RNA, an interaction crucial for recruitment of A3G to the virion; yet, A3G displays no deamination activity for cytidines in viral RNA. Here, we report NMR and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis for interactions between A3Gctd and multiple substrate or non-substrate DNA and RNA, in combination with deamination assays. NMR ssDNA-binding experiments revealed that the interaction with residues in helix1 and loop1 (T201-L220) distinguishes the binding mode of substrate ssDNA from non-substrate. Using 2-deoxy-2-fluorine substituted cytidines, we show that a 2-endo sugar conformation of the target deoxycytidine is favored for substrate binding and deamination. Trajectories of the MD simulation indicate that a ribose 2-hydroxyl group destabilizes the - stacking of the target cytosine and H257, resulting in dislocation of the target cytosine base from the catalytic position. Interestingly, APOBEC3A, which can deaminate ribocytidines, retains the ribocytidine in the catalytic position throughout the MD simulation. Our results indicate that A3Gctd catalytic selectivity against RNA is dictated by both the sugar conformation and 2- hydroxyl group.},

To determine the DNA-binding affinity of the dimeric drug molecule, microscale thermophoresis was applied. This is the first utilization of this method to assess the binding interactions of an anthracycline drug with nucleic acids.

In eukaryotes, translating ribosomes are slowed down by the Alu domain of SRP to allow efficient targeting. In prokaryotes, however, little is known about the structure and function of Alu domain-containing SRPs. Here, we report a complete molecular model of SRP from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, based on cryo-EM. The SRP comprises two subunits, 6S RNA and SRP54 or Ffh, and it facilitates elongation slowdown similarly to its eukaryotic counterpart. However, protein contacts with the small ribosomal subunit observed for the mammalian Alu domain are substituted in bacteria by RNA-RNA interactions of 6S RNA with the [alpha]-sarcin-ricin loop and helices H43 and H44 of 23S rRNA. Our findings provide a structural basis for cotranslational targeting and RNA-driven elongation arrest in prokaryotes.},

abstract = {In order to survive and persist in an immunocompetent human host, Borrelia burgdorferi controls the human immune attack and blocks the damaging effects of the activated complement system. These Gram-negative spirochetes use CspA (CRASP-1) and four additional immune evasion proteins to bind combinations of human plasma regulators, including factor H, factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1), complement factor H-related protein 1 (CFHR1), CFHR2, CFHR5, and plasminogen. As many microbial immune evasion proteins have multiple functions, we hypothesized that CspA has additional roles in complement or immune control. Here, we identify CspA as a terminal complement inhibitor. Borrelial CspA binds the human terminal complement components C7 and C9 and blocks assembly and membrane insertion of the terminal complement complex (TCC). CspA inhibits TCC assembly at the level of C7, as revealed by hemolytic assays, and inhibits polymerization of C9. CspA, when ectopically expressed on the surface of serum-sensitive Borrelia garinii, blocks TCC assembly on the level of C7 and induces serum resistance in the transformed bacteria. This CspA-mediated serum resistance and terminal complement pathway inhibition allow B. burgdorferi to survive in the hostile environment of human plasma.IMPORTANCE The present study defines a new mechanism by which the pathogenic bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi controls the terminal complement pathway of the human host to survive in human serum. The borrelial CspA binds to terminal pathway proteins C7 and C9 and inhibits the terminal complement pathway at the step of C7 and thereby inhibits terminal complement complex (TCC) assembly and membrane insertion. CspA blocks TCC assembly and insertion when expressed at the bacterial surface. CspA is the first TCC inhibitor cloned and functionally characterized from a Gram-negative bacterium. This identification of a bacterial TCC inhibitor of pathogen origin expands our knowledge of complement evasion of pathogenic bacteria and shows that pathogenic bacteria target the terminal pathway of complement. Thus, CspA as a central microbial virulence factor can represent an interesting biomarker and a target to develop new therapeutics and vaccines against borreliae.},

We designed and synthesized five novel peptidic DAA-containing kinase inhibitors of protein kinase A using a sophisticated molecular dynamics protocol and solid-phase peptide synthesis. By means of a thermophoresis binding assay, NMR, and crystal structure analysis, we determined the influence of the DAAs on the secondary structure and binding affinity in comparison to the native protein kinase inhibitor, which is purely composed of proteinogenic amino acids. Affinity and binding pose are largely conserved. One variant showed 6.5-fold potency improvement, most likely related to its increased side chain lipophilicity. A second variant exhibited slightly decreased affinity presumably due to loss of hydrogen-bond contacts to surrounding water molecules of the first solvation shell.},

The mammary-derived growth inhibitor (MDGI/FABP3) was identified as its interacting partner. Here, we present an alanine scan of A-CooP to investigate the contribution of each amino acid residue to the binding to FABP3 by microscale thermophoresis (MST) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). We also tested the binding affinity of the A-CooP-K, KA-CooP, and retro-inverso A-CooP analogues to the recombinant FABP3. According to the MST analysis, A-CooP showed micromolar (KD = 2.18 µM) affinity to FABP3. Alanine replacement of most of the amino acids did not affect peptide affinity to FABP3. The A-CooP-K variant showed superior binding affinity, while A-[Ala5]CooP and A-[Ala7]CooP, both replacing a glycine residue with alanine, showed negligible binding to FABP3. These results were corroborated in vitro and in vivo using glioblastoma models. Both A-CooP-K and A-CooP showed excellent binding in vitro and homing in vivo, while A-[Ala5]CooP and control peptides failed to bind the cells or home to the intracranial glioblastoma xenografts. These results provide insight into the FABP3–A-CooP interaction that may be important for future applications of drug conjugate design and development.},

abstract = {Multivalent interactions at biological interfaces occur frequently in nature and mediate recognition and interactions in essential physiological processes such as cell-to-cell adhesion. Multivalency is also a key principle that allows tight binding between pathogens and host cells during the initial stages of infection. One promising approach to prevent infection is the design of synthetic or semisynthetic multivalent binders that interfere with pathogen adhesion1–4. Here, we present a multivalent binder that is based on a spatially defined arrangement of ligands for the viral spike protein haemagglutinin of the influenza A virus. Complementary experimental and theoretical approaches demonstrate that bacteriophage capsids, which carry host cell haemagglutinin ligands in an arrangement matching the geometry of binding sites of the spike protein, can bind to viruses in a defined multivalent mode. These capsids cover the entire virus envelope, thus preventing its binding to the host cell as visualized by cryo-electron tomography. As a consequence, virus infection can be inhibited in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Such highly functionalized capsids present an alternative to strategies that target virus entry by spike-inhibiting antibodies5 and peptides6 or that address late steps of the viral replication cycle7},

abstract = {Bacterial tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (Tgt) catalyses the exchange of the genetically encoded guanine at the wobble position of tRNAs(His,Tyr,Asp,Asn) by the premodified base preQ1, which is further converted to queuine at the tRNA level. As eucaryotes are not able to synthesise queuine de novo but acquire it through their diet, eucaryotic Tgt directly inserts the hypermodified base into the wobble position of the tRNAs mentioned above. Bacterial Tgt is required for the efficient pathogenicity of Shigella sp, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery and, hence, it constitutes a putative target for the rational design of anti-Shigellosis compounds. Since mammalian Tgt is known to be indirectly essential to the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, it is necessary to create substances which only inhibit bacterial but not eucaryotic Tgt. Therefore, it seems of utmost importance to study selectivity-determining features within both types of proteins. Homology models of Caenorhabditis elegans Tgt and human Tgt suggest that the replacement of Cys158 and Val233 in bacterial Tgt (Zymomonas mobilis Tgt numbering) by valine and accordingly glycine in eucaryotic Tgt largely accounts for the different substrate specificities. In the present study we have created mutated variants of Z. mobilis Tgt in order to investigate the impact of a Cys158Val and a Val233Gly exchange on catalytic activity and substrate specificity. Using enzyme kinetics and X-ray crystallography, we gained evidence that the Cys158Val mutation reduces the affinity to preQ1 while leaving the affinity to guanine unaffected. The Val233Gly exchange leads to an enlarged substrate binding pocket, that is necessary to accommodate queuine in a conformation compatible with the intermediately covalently bound tRNA molecule. Contrary to our expectations, we found that a priori queuine is recognised by the binding pocket of bacterial Tgt without, however, being used as a substrate.},

abstract = {Summary srGAP proteins regulate cell migration and morphogenesis by shaping the structure and dynamics of the cytoskeleton and membranes. First discovered as intracellular effectors for the Robo1 axon-guidance receptor, srGAPs were later identified as interacting with several other nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. In all these cases, the srGAP SH3 domain mediates protein-protein interactions by recognizing a short proline-rich segment on the cognate-binding partner. However, as interactions between the isolated SH3 domain and a selected set of ligands show weak affinity and low specificity, it is not clear how srGAPs are precisely recruited to their signaling sites. Here, we report a two-component molecular mechanism that regulates ligand binding to srGAP2 by on the one hand dramatically tightening their association and on the other, moderately autoinhibiting and restricting binding. Our results allow the design of point mutations for better probing of srGAP2 activities, and may facilitate the identification of new srGAP2 ligands.},

abstract = {Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) control many cellular processes and are considered important therapeutic targets. Large collections of inhibitors targeting CDK active sites have been discovered, but their use in chemical biology or drug development has been often hampered by their general lack of specificity. An alternative approach to develop more specific inhibitors is targeting protein interactions involving CDKs. CKS proteins interact with some CDKs and play important roles in cell division. We discovered two small-molecule inhibitors of CDK-CKS interactions. They bind to CDK2, do not inhibit its enzymatic activity, inhibit the proliferation of tumor cell lines, induce an increase in G1 and/or S-phase cell populations, and cause a decrease in CDK2, cyclin A, and p27(Kip1) levels. These molecules should help decipher the complex contributions of CDK-CKS complexes in the regulation of cell division, and they might present an interesting therapeutic potential.},

abstract = {During telophase, the nuclear envelope (NE) reforms around daughter nuclei to ensure proper segregation of nuclear and cytoplasmic contents. NE reformation requires the coating of chromatin by membrane derived from the endoplasmic reticulum, and a subsequent annular fusion step to ensure that the formed envelope is sealed. How annular fusion is accomplished is unknown, but it is thought to involve the p97 AAA-ATPase complex and bears a topological equivalence to the membrane fusion event that occurs during the abscission phase of cytokinesis. Here we show that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport-III (ESCRT-III) machinery localizes to sites of annular fusion in the forming NE in human cells, and is necessary for proper post-mitotic nucleo-cytoplasmic compartmentalization. The ESCRT-III component charged multivesicular body protein 2A (CHMP2A) is directed to the forming NE through binding to CHMP4B, and provides an activity essential for NE reformation. Localization also requires the p97 complex member ubiquitin fusion and degradation 1 (UFD1). Our results describe a novel role for the ESCRT machinery in cell division and demonstrate a conservation of the machineries involved in topologically equivalent mitotic membrane remodelling events.},

abstract = {KEY MESSAGE We identify proteins that associate with the THO core complex, and show that the TEX1 and MOS11 components functionally interact, affecting mRNA export and splicing as well as plant development. TREX (TRanscription-EXport) is a multiprotein complex that plays a central role in the coordination of synthesis, processing and nuclear export of mRNAs. Using targeted proteomics, we identified proteins that associate with the THO core complex of Arabidopsis TREX. In addition to the RNA helicase UAP56 and the mRNA export factors ALY2-4 and MOS11 we detected interactions with the mRNA export complex TREX-2 and multiple spliceosomal components. Plants defective in the THO component TEX1 or in the mRNA export factor MOS11 (orthologue of human CIP29) are mildly affected. However, tex1 mos11 double-mutant plants show marked defects in vegetative and reproductive development. In tex1 plants, the levels of tasiRNAs are reduced, while miR173 levels are decreased in mos11 mutants. In nuclei of mos11 cells increased mRNA accumulation was observed, while no mRNA export defect was detected with tex1 cells. Nevertheless, in tex1 mos11 double-mutants, the mRNA export defect was clearly enhanced relative to mos11. The subnuclear distribution of TEX1 substantially overlaps with that of splicing-related SR proteins and in tex1 plants the ratio of certain alternative splicing events is altered. Our results demonstrate that Arabidopsis TEX1 and MOS11 are involved in distinct steps of the biogenesis of mRNAs and small RNAs, and that they interact regarding some aspects, but act independently in others.},

abstract = {GPIHBP1 is a glycolipid-anchored membrane protein of capillary endothelial cells that binds lipoprotein lipase (LPL) within the interstitial space and shuttles it to the capillary lumen. The LPL•GPIHBP1 complex is responsible for margination of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins along capillaries and their lipolytic processing. The current work conceptualizes a model for the GPIHBP1•LPL interaction based on biophysical measurements with hydrogen-deuterium exchange/mass spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance, and zero-length cross-linking. According to this model, GPIHBP1 comprises two functionally distinct domains: (1) an intrinsically disordered acidic N-terminal domain; and (2) a folded C-terminal domain that tethers GPIHBP1 to the cell membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol. We demonstrate that these domains serve different roles in regulating the kinetics of LPL binding. Importantly, the acidic domain stabilizes LPL catalytic activity by mitigating the global unfolding of LPL's catalytic domain. This study provides a conceptual framework for understanding intravascular lipolysis and GPIHBP1 and LPL mutations causing familial chylomicronemia.},

abstract = {Calcium (Ca(2+)) and redox signalling play important roles in acclimation processes from archaea to eukaryotic organisms. Herein we characterized a unique protein from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that has the competence to integrate Ca(2+)- and redox-related signalling. This protein, designated as calredoxin (CRX), combines four Ca(2+)-binding EF-hands and a thioredoxin (TRX) domain. A crystal structure of CRX, at 1.6 {\AA} resolution, revealed an unusual calmodulin-fold of the Ca(2+)-binding EF-hands, which is functionally linked via an inter-domain communication path with the enzymatically active TRX domain. CRX is chloroplast-localized and interacted with a chloroplast 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (PRX1). Ca(2+)-binding to CRX is critical for its TRX activity and for efficient binding and reduction of PRX1. Thereby, CRX represents a new class of Ca(2+)-dependent 'sensor-responder' proteins. Genetically engineered Chlamydomonas strains with strongly diminished amounts of CRX revealed altered photosynthetic electron transfer and were affected in oxidative stress response underpinning a function of CRX in stress acclimation.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and, after age, the greatest risk factor for developing AD is the allelic variation of apolipoprotein E (ApoE), with homozygote carriers of the ApoE4 allele having an up to 12-fold greater risk of developing AD than noncarriers. Apolipoprotein E exists as three isoforms that differ in only two amino acid sites, ApoE2 (Cys112/Cys158), ApoE3 (Cys112/Arg158), and ApoE4 (Arg112/Arg158). These amino acid substitutions are assumed to alter ApoE structure and function, and be responsible for the detrimental effects of ApoE4 via a mechanism that remains unclear. The hypothesis that a structural difference between ApoE4 and ApoE3 (and ApoE2) is the cause of the ApoE4-associated increased risk for AD forms the basis of a therapeutic approach to modulate ApoE4 structure, and we were therefore interested in screening to identify new chemical probes for ApoE4. In this regard, a high-yield protocol was developed for the expression and purification of recombinant full-length ApoE, and three diverse biophysical screening assays were established and characterized; an optical label-free assay (Corning Epic) for hit identification and microscale thermophoresis (MST) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) as orthogonal assays for hit confirmation. The 707 compounds in the National Institute of Health clinical collection were screened for binding to ApoE4, from which six confirmed hits, as well as one analogue, were identified. Although the compounds did not differentiate between ApoE isoforms, these data nevertheless demonstrate the feasibility of using a biophysical approach to identifying compounds that bind to ApoE and that, with further optimization, might differentiate between isoforms to produce a molecule that selectively alters the function of ApoE4.},

abstract = {Serpin protease inhibitors and $\beta$-amylase starch hydrolases are very abundant seed proteins in the endosperm of grasses. $\beta$-amylase is a crucial enzyme in the beer industry providing maltose for fermenting yeast. In animals and plants, inhibitory serpins form covalent linkages that inactivate their cognate proteases. Additionally, in animals, noninhibitory functions for serpins are observed such as metabolite carriers and chaperones. The function of serpins in seeds has yet to be unveiled. In developing endosperm, serpin Z4 and $\beta$-amylase showed similar in vivo spatio-temporal accumulation properties and colocalize in the cytosol of transformed tobacco leaves. A molecular interaction between recombinant proteins of serpin Z4 and $\beta$-amylase was revealed by surface plasmon resonance and microscale thermophoresis yielding a dissociation constant of 10-7 M. Importantly, the addition of serpin Z4 significantly changes $\beta$-amylase enzymatic properties by increasing its maximal catalytic velocity. The presence of serpin Z4 stabilizes $\beta$-amylase activity during heat treatment without affecting its critical denaturing temperature. Oxidative stress, simulated by the addition of CuCl2, leads to the formation of high molecular weight polymers of $\beta$-amylase similar to those detected in vivo. The polymers were cross-linked through disulfide bonds, the formation of which was repressed when serpin Z4 was present. The results suggest an unprecedented function for a plant seed serpin as a $\beta$-amylase-specific chaperone-like partner that could optimize $\beta$-amylase activity upon germination. This report is the first to describe a noninhibitory function for a serpin in plants.},

abstract = {Calmodulin (CaM) functions depend on interactions with CaM-binding proteins, regulated by Ca2+. Induced structural changes influence the affinity, kinetics, and specificities of the interactions. The dynamics of CaM interactions with neurogranin (Ng) and the CaM-binding region of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII290-309 ) have been studied using biophysical methods. These proteins have opposite Ca2+ dependencies for CaM binding. Surface plasmon resonance biosensor analysis confirmed that Ca2+ and CaM interact very rapidly, and with moderate affinity ( KDSPR=3$\mu$M). Calmodulin-CaMKII290-309 interactions were only detected in the presence of Ca2+, exhibiting fast kinetics and nanomolar affinity ( KDSPR=7.1nM). The CaM-Ng interaction had higher affinity under Ca2+-depleted ( KDSPR=480nM,k1=3.4×105M-1s-1 and k-1 = 1.6 × 10-1 s-1 ) than Ca2+-saturated conditions ( KDSPR=19$\mu$M). The IQ motif of Ng (Ng27-50 ) had similar affinity for CaM as Ng under Ca2+-saturated conditions ( KDSPR=14$\mu$M), but no interaction was seen under Ca2+-depleted conditions. Microscale thermophoresis using fluorescently labeled CaM confirmed the surface plasmon resonance results qualitatively, but estimated lower affinities for the Ng ( KDMST=890nM) and CaMKII290-309 ( KDMST=190nM) interactions. Although CaMKII290-309 showed expected interaction characteristics, they may be different for full-length CaMKII. The data for full-length Ng, but not Ng27-50 , agree with the current model on Ng regulation of Ca2+/CaM signaling.},

This technique makes it possible to study interactions between miRNAs and various oligonucleotide inhibitors, independent of the chemical modifications of the inhibitors or their respective target structure, with very little sample volume required compared to competitive techniques, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Interaction studies between these inhibitors and their respective target structures were performed, and they allowed the assessment of binding characteristics and parameters, such as EC50 for a number of these inhibitors, with little effort. Furthermore, MST could be utilized for obtaining kinetic binding data of the Argonaute-2 protein with a miRNA, which showed a possible RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)-mediated turnover of inhibited miRNAs.},

abstract = {LiaR is a 'master regulator' of the cell envelope stress response in enterococci and many other Gram-positive organisms. Mutations to liaR can lead to antibiotic resistance to a variety of antibiotics including the cyclic lipopeptide daptomycin. LiaR is phosphorylated in response to membrane stress to regulate downstream target operons. Using DNA footprinting of the regions upstream of the liaXYZ and liaFSR operons we show that LiaR binds an extended stretch of DNA that extends beyond the proposed canonical consensus sequence suggesting a more complex level of regulatory control of target operons. We go on to determine the biochemical and structural basis for increased resistance to daptomycin by the adaptive mutation to LiaR (D191N) first identified from the pathogen Enterococcus faecalis S613. LiaR(D191N) increases oligomerization of LiaR to form a constitutively activated tetramer that has high affinity for DNA even in the absence of phosphorylation leading to increased resistance. Crystal structures of the LiaR DNA binding domain complexed to the putative consensus sequence as well as an adjoining secondary sequence show that upon binding, LiaR induces DNA bending that is consistent with increased recruitment of RNA polymerase to the transcription start site and upregulation of target operons.},

abstract = {Guanine quadruplexes can form in both DNA and RNA and influence many biological processes through various protein interactions. The DEAD-box RNA helicase protein DDX21 has been shown to bind and remodel RNA quadruplexes but little is known about its specificity for different quadruplex species. Previous reports have suggested DDX21 may interact with telomeric repeat containing RNA quadruplex (TERRA), an integral component of the telomere that contributes to telomeric heterochromatin formation and telomere length regulation. Here we report that the C-terminus of DDX21 directly interacts with TERRA. We use, for the first time, 2D saturation transfer difference NMR to map the protein binding site on a ribonucleic acid species and show that the quadruplex binding domain of DDX21 interacts primarily with the phosphoribose backbone of quadruplexes. Furthermore, by mutating the 2′OH of loop nucleotides we can drastically reduce DDX21's affinity for quadruplex, indicating that the recognition of quadruplex and specificity for TERRA is mediated by interactions with the 2′OH of loop nucleotides.},

abstract = {An aptamer was previously selected against the anaphylactic allergen $\beta$-conglutin ($\beta$-CBA I), which was subsequently truncated to an 11-mer and the affinity improved by two orders of magnitude. The work reported here details the selection and characterisation of a second aptamer ($\beta$-CBA II) selected against a second aptatope on the $\beta$-conglutin target. The affinity of this second aptamer was similar to that of the 11-mer, and its affinity was confirmed by three different techniques at three independent laboratories. This $\beta$-CBA II aptamer in combination with the previously selected $\beta$-CBA I was then exploited to a dual-aptamer approach. The specific and simultaneous binding of the dual aptamer ($\beta$-CBA I and $\beta$-CBA II) to different sites of $\beta$-conglutin was confirmed using both microscale thermophoresis and surface plasmon resonance where $\beta$-CBA II serves as the primary capturing aptamer and $\beta$-CBA I or the truncated $\beta$-CBA I (11-mer) as the secondary signalling aptamer, which can be further exploited in enzyme-linked aptamer assays and aptasensors.},

abstract = {WRINKLED1 (WRI1), the transcriptional activator of fatty acid synthesis, was recently identified as a target of KIN10, a catalytic $\alpha$-subunit of the SUCROSE-NON-FERMENTING1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE1 (SnRK1). We tested the hypothesis that trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P), a signal of cellular sucrose status, can regulate fatty acid synthesis by inhibiting SnRK1. Incubation of Brassica napus suspension cells in medium containing T6P, or overexpression of the Escherichia coli T6P synthase, OtsA, in Nicotiana benthamiana, significantly increased T6P levels, WRI1 levels, and fatty acid synthesis rates. T6P directly bound to purified recombinant KIN10 with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 32 ± 6 $\mu$M based on microscale thermophoresis. GEMINIVIRUS REP-INTERACTING KINASE1 (GRIK1) bound to KIN10 (Kd 19 ± 3 $\mu$M) and activated it by phosphorylation. In the presence of T6P, the GRIK1-KIN10 association was weakened by more than 3-fold (Kd 68 ± 9.8 $\mu$M), which reduced both the phosphorylation of KIN10 and its activity. T6P-dependent inhibition of SnRK1 activity was reduced in extracts of individual Arabidopsis thaliana grik1 and grik2 mutants relative to the wild type, while SnRK1 activity in grik1 grik2 extracts was enhanced by T6P. These results indicate that the T6P sensitivity of SnRK1 in vivo is GRIK1/GRIK2 dependent. Based on our findings, we propose a mechanistic model that links sugar signaling and fatty acid homeostasis.},

abstract = {We describe for the first time a method that utilizes microscale thermophoresis (MST) technology to determine polyclonal antibody affinities to small molecules. Using a novel type of heterologous MST, we have accurately measured a solution-based binding affinity of serum antibodies to heroin which was previously impossible with other currently available methods. Moreover, this mismatch approach (i.e., using a cross-reactive hapten tracer) has never been reported in the literature. When compared with equilibrium dialysis combined with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (ED-UPLC/MS/MS), this novel MST method yields similar binding affinity values for polyclonal antibodies to the major heroin metabolites 6-AM and morphine. Additionally, we herein report the method of synthesis of this novel cross-reactive hapten, MorHap-acetamide—a useful analog for the study of heroin hapten–antibody interactions. Using heterologous MST, we were able to determine the affinities, down to nanomolar accuracies, of polyclonal antibodies to various abused opioids. While optimizing this method, we further discovered that heroin is protected from serum esterase degradation by the presence of these antibodies in a concentration-dependent manner. Lastly, using affinity data for a number of structurally different opioids, we were able to dissect the moieties that are crucial to antibody binding. The novel MST method that is presented herein can be extended to the analysis of any ligand that is prone to degradation and can be applied not only to the development of vaccines to substances of abuse but also to the analysis of small molecule/protein interactions in the presence of serum.

abstract = {Aptamers are single-stranded oligonucleotides which can be used as alternative recognition elements for protein detection, because aptamers bind their targets with a high affinity similar to antibodies. Due to the targetinduced conformational changes of aptamers, these oligonucleotides can be applied in various biosensing platforms. In this work, aptamers directed against the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were used as a model system. VEGF plays a key role in physiological angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Furthermore, VEGF is involved in the development and growth of cancer and other diseases like agerelated macular degeneration, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, and neurodegenerative disorders. Detecting the protein biomarker VEGF is therefore of great importance for medical research and diagnostics. In this research, VEGFbinding aptamers were investigated for the systematic development of a targetinduced dissociation (TID) assay utilizing thermophoresis and microarrays. The established aptamer-microarray allowed for the detection of 0.1 nM of VEGF. Furthermore, the systematic development of the TID method using the VEGF model protein could help to develop further TID assays for the detection of various protein biomarkers.},

abstract = {Toxin A (TcdA) and B (TcdB) from Clostridium difficile enter host cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. A prerequisite for proper toxin action is the intracellular release of the glucosyltransferase domain by an inherent cysteine protease, which is allosterically activated by inositol hexaphosphate (IP6). We found that in in vitro assays, the C-terminally-truncated TcdA1–1065 was more efficient at IP6-induced cleavage compared with full-length TcdA. We hypothesized that the C-terminally-located combined repetitive oligopeptides (CROPs) interact with the N-terminal part of the toxin, thereby preventing autoproteolysis. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays and microscale thermophoresis confirmed binding between the CROPs and the glucosyltransferase (TcdA1–542) or intermediate (TcdA1102–1847) domain of TcdA, respectively. This interaction between the N- and C-terminus was not found for TcdB. Functional assays revealed that TcdB was more susceptible to inactivation by extracellular IP6-induced cleavage. In vitro autoprocessing and inactivation of TcdA, however, significantly increased, either by acidification of the surrounding milieu or following exchange of its CROP domain by the homologous CROP domain of TcdB. Thus, TcdA CROPs contribute to the stabilization and protection of toxin conformation in addition to function as the main receptor binding domain.},

Our combined approach allowed for visualization of the small subunit as it assembled and revealed that with the exception of key helices in the platform domain, all other 16S rRNA domains fold even in the absence of Era. Notably, the maturing particles did not stall while waiting for the platform domain to mature and instead re-routed their folding pathway to enable concerted maturation of other structural motifs spanning multiple rRNA domains. We also found that binding of Era to the mature 30S subunit destabilized helix 44 and the decoding center preventing binding of YjeQ, another assembly factor.

abstract = {Summary During red-blood-cell-stage infection of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite undergoes repeated rounds of replication, egress, and invasion. Erythrocyte invasion involves specific interactions between host cell receptors and parasite ligands and coordinated expression of genes specific to this step of the life cycle. We show that a parasite-specific bromodomain protein, PfBDP1, binds to chromatin at transcriptional start sites of invasion-related genes and directly controls their expression. Conditional PfBDP1 knockdown causes a dramatic defect in parasite invasion and growth and results in transcriptional downregulation of multiple invasion-related genes at a time point critical for invasion. Conversely, PfBDP1 overexpression enhances expression of these same invasion-related genes. PfBDP1 binds to acetylated histone H3 and a second bromodomain protein, PfBDP2, suggesting a potential mechanism for gene recognition and control. Collectively, these findings show that PfBDP1 critically coordinates expression of invasion genes and indicate that targeting PfBDP1 could be an invaluable tool in malaria eradication.},

We previously demonstrated that neurogenin 2 (NEUROG2), forskolin (F), and dorsomorphin (D) can reprogram fibroblasts into functional neurons with high efficiency. Here, we??used this model to define the genetic and epigenetic events that initiate an acquisition of neuronal identity. We demonstrate that NEUROG2 is a pioneer factor, FD enhances chromatin accessibility and H3K27 acetylation, and synergistic transcription activated by these factors is essential to successful reprogramming. CREB1 promotes neuron survival and acts with NEUROG2 to upregulate SOX4, which co-activates NEUROD1 and NEUROD4. In addition, SOX4 targets SWI/SNF subunits and SOX4 knockdown results in extensive loss of open chromatin and abolishes reprogramming. Applying these insights, adult human glioblastoma cell and skin fibroblast reprogramming can be improved using SOX4 or chromatin-modifying chemicals.},

abstract = {During mitosis, the spindle checkpoint senses kinetochores not properly attached to spindle microtubules and prevents precocious sister-chromatid separation and aneuploidy. The constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) at inner kinetochores anchors the KMN network consisting of Knl1, the Mis12 complex (Mis12C), and the Ndc80 complex (Ndc80C) at outer kinetochores. KMN is a critical kinetochore receptor for both microtubules and checkpoint proteins. Here, we show that nearly complete inactivation of KMN in human cells through multiple strategies produced strong checkpoint defects even when all kinetochores lacked microtubule attachment. These KMN-inactivating strategies reveal multiple KMN assembly mechanisms at human mitotic kinetochores. In one mechanism, the centromeric kinase Aurora B phosphorylates Mis12C and strengthens its binding to the CCAN subunit CENP-C. In another, CENP-T contributes to KMN attachment in a CENP-H-I-K-dependent manner. Our study provides insights into the mechanisms of mitosis-specific assembly of the checkpoint platform KMN at human kinetochores. $\backslash$n{\textcopyright} 2015 Kim and Yu.},

abstract = {SecB chaperones assist protein export by binding both unfolded proteins and the SecA motor. Certain SecB homologs can also control toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems known to modulate bacterial growth in response to stress. In such TA-chaperone (TAC) systems, SecB assists the folding and prevents degradation of the antitoxin, thus facilitating toxin inhibition. Chaperone dependency is conferred by a C-terminal extension in the antitoxin known as chaperone addiction (ChAD) sequence, which makes the antitoxin aggregation-prone and prevents toxin inhibition. Using TAC of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we present the structure of a SecB-like chaperone bound to its ChAD peptide. We find differences in the binding interfaces when compared to SecB–SecA or SecB-preprotein complexes, and show that the antitoxin can reach a functional form while bound to the chaperone. This work reveals how chaperones can use discrete surface binding regions to accommodate different clients or partners and thereby expand their substrate repertoire and functions.},

abstract = {Dominant mutations in p97/VCP (valosin-containing protein) cause a rare multisystem degenerative disease with varied phenotypes that include inclusion body myopathy, Paget's disease of bone, frontotemporal dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. p97 disease mutants have altered N-domain conformations, elevated ATPase activity, and altered cofactor association. We have now discovered a previously unidentified disease-relevant functional property of p97 by identifying how the cofactors p37 and p47 regulate p97 ATPase activity. We define p37 as, to our knowledge, the first known p97-activating cofactor, which enhances the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of p97 by 11-fold. Whereas both p37 and p47 decrease the Km of ATP in p97, p37 increases the kcat of p97. In contrast, regulation by p47 is biphasic, with decreased kcat at low levels but increased kcat at higher levels. By deleting a region of p47 that lacks homology to p37 (amino acids 69-92), we changed p47 from an inhibitory cofactor to an activating cofactor, similar to p37. Our data suggest that cofactors regulate p97 ATPase activity by binding to the N domain. Induced conformation changes affect ADP/ATP binding at the D1 domain, which in turn controls ATPase cycling. Most importantly, we found that the D2 domain of disease mutants failed to be activated by p37 or p47. Our results show that cofactors play a critical role in controlling p97 ATPase activity, and suggest that lack of cofactor-regulated communication may contribute to p97-associated disease pathogenesis.},

Still, the mechanism underlying the disease processes largely remains undetermined. In age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a common cause of vision impairment and blindness in industrialized societies, two synonymous polymorphisms (rs1049331:C{\textgreater}T, and rs2293870:G{\textgreater}T) in exon 1 of the HTRA1 genewere associated with a high risk to develop disease. Here, we show that the two polymorphisms result in a protein with altered thermophoretic properties upon heat-induced unfolding, trypsin accessibility and secretion behavior, suggesting unique structural features of the AMD-risk-associated HTRA1 protein. Applying MicroScale Thermophoresis and protease digestion analysis, we demonstrate direct binding and proteolysis of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) by normal HTRA1 but not the AMD-risk-associated isoform. As a consequence, both HTRA1 isoforms strongly differed in their ability to control TGF-beta mediated signaling, as revealed by reporter assays targeting the TGF-beta 1-induced serpin peptidase inhibitor (SERPINE1, alias PAI-1) promoter. In addition, structurally altered HTRA1 led to an impaired autocrine TGF-beta signaling in microglia, as measured by a strong down-regulation of downstream effectors of the TGF-beta cascade such as phosphorylated SMAD2 and PAI-1 expression. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the effects of two synonymous HTRA1 variants on protein structure and protein interaction with TGF-beta 1. As a consequence, this leads to an impairment of TGF-beta signaling and microglial regulation. Functional implications of the altered properties on AMD pathogenesis remain to be clarified.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop a method combining chiral separation and biophysical techniques to evaluate the enantioselective affinity of original sulfonamide derivatives towards their therapeutic target, the human carbonic anhydrase II (hACII). The first step consisted in the preparation of the enantiomers by chromatographic separation. The performances of HPLC and Supercritical Fluid Chromatography (SFC) were studied at the analytical scale by optimization of various experimental conditions using adsorbed polysaccharide chiral stationary phases (amylose AD-H and cellulose OD-H). Since SFC allowed obtaining higher enantioresolutions per time unit, it was selected for the semi-preparative scale and successfully used to isolate each enantiomer with a satisfactory enantiomeric purity ({\textgreater}98{\%}). Secondly, microscale thermophoresis (MST) method and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) used as reference method were developed to measure potential enantioselective affinities of these enantiomers towards the hACII. The optimizations of both methods were performed using a reference compound, i.e. acetazolamide, which affinity for hCAII has previously been demonstrated. For all compounds, KD values obtained using MST and SPR were in good agreement, leading to similar affinity scales despite both approaches totally differ (labeling for MST versus immobilization of the protein for SPR). The equilibrium dissociation constants of our original compounds for the hCAII were in the range 100–1000 nM and an enantioselectivity was observed using the MST and SPR methods for the diarylpyrazole 2. Finally, by comparing the MST and SPR techniques, MST appears especially adapted for further screening of a series of sulfonamide derivatives due to the lower time required to estimate a binding constant while consuming as little hCAII as SPR.},

abstract = {Bacteriophages must rapidly deploy anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs) to inactivate the RNA-guided nucleases that enforce CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity in their bacterial hosts. Listeria monocytogenes temperate phages encode up to three anti-Cas9 proteins, with acrIIA1 always present. AcrIIA1 binds and inhibits Cas9 with its C-terminal domain; however, the function of its highly conserved N-terminal domain (NTD) is unknown. Here, we report that the AcrIIA1NTD is a critical transcriptional repressor of the strong anti-CRISPR promoter. A rapid burst of anti-CRISPR transcription occurs during phage infection and the subsequent negative feedback by AcrIIA1NTD is required for optimal phage replication, even in the absence of CRISPR-Cas immunity. In the presence of CRISPR-Cas immunity, full-length AcrIIA1 uses its two-domain architecture to act as a “Cas9 sensor,” tuning acr expression according to Cas9 levels. Finally, we identify AcrIIA1NTD homologs in other Firmicutes and demonstrate that they have been co-opted by hosts as “anti-anti-CRISPRs,” repressing phage anti-CRISPR deployment.},

We synthesized and screened pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoxaline derivatives, yielding the first synthetic Sirt6 activators. Biochemical assays show direct, substrate-independent compound binding to the Sirt6 catalytic core and potent activation of Sirt6-dependent deacetylation of peptide substrates and complete nucleosomes. Crystal structures of Sirt6/activator complexes reveal that the compounds bind to a Sirt6-specific acyl channel pocket and identify key interactions.

abstract = {The interest in RNA modification enzymes surges due to their involvement in epigenetic phenomena. Here we present a particularly informative approach to investigate the interaction of dye-labeled RNA with modification enzymes. We investigated pseudouridine ($\Psi$) synthase TruB interacting with an alleged suicide substrate RNA containing 5-fluorouridine (5FU). A longstanding dogma, stipulating formation of a stable covalent complex was challenged by discrepancies between the time scale of complex formation and enzymatic turnover. Instead of classic mutagenesis, we used differentially positioned fluorescent labels to modulate substrate properties in a range of enzymatic conversion between 6{\%} and 99{\%}. Despite this variegation, formation of SDS-stable complexes occurred instantaneously for all 5FU-substrates. Protein binding was investigated by advanced fluorescence spectroscopy allowing unprecedented simultaneous detection of change in fluorescence lifetime, anisotropy decay, as well as emission and excitation maxima. Determination of Kd values showed that introduction of 5FU into the RNA substrate increased protein affinity by 14× at most. Finally, competition experiments demonstrated reversibility of complex formation for 5FU-RNA. Our results lead us to conclude that the hitherto postulated long-term covalent interaction of TruB with 5FU tRNA is based on the interpretation of artifacts. This is likely true for the entire class of pseudouridine synthases.},

Mutations in ACTB, the gene encoding cytoplasmic $\beta$-actin, lead to severe disorders with a broad range of symptoms. The two dominant heterozygous gain-of-function $\beta$-actin mutations p.R183W and p.E364K were identified in patients with developmental malformations, deafness and juvenile-onset dystonia (p.R183W) and neutrophil dysfunction (p.E364K). Here, we report the recombinant production and functional characterization of the two mutant proteins. Arg183 is located near the nucleotide-binding pocket of actin. Our results from biochemical studies and molecular dynamics simulations show that replacement by a tryptophan residue at position 183 establishes an unusual stacking interaction with Tyr69 that perturbs nucleotide release from actin monomers and polymerization behavior by inducing a closed state conformation. The replacement of Glu364 by a lysine residue appears to act as an allosteric trigger event leading to the preferred formation of the closed state. Thus, our approach indicates that both mutations affect interdomain mobility and nucleotide interactions as a basis for the formation of disease phenotypes in patients.},

The fidelity of this phosphotransfer reaction from the SK to the RR provides specificity to TCS signaling. In the present study, we show that for TcrX, a transcriptionally autoregulated RR of M. tuberculosis, acetylation enhances its net phosphorylation from cognate SK TcrY and lowers it from a non-cognate SK MtrB. Similar acetylation mediated increase in phosphorylation was also observed for another RR MtrA from cognate SK MtrB. Thus, we establish a novel TCS signaling design wherein acetylation of RRs results in enhanced cognate phosphorylation and suppresses non-cognate phosphorylation. Using wild type or acetylation-deficient TcrX proteins in M. tuberculosis H37Ra, we demonstrate that non-acetylated TcrX acts as a ‘phosphate sink' for MtrB and suppressing signal propagation from MtrB to MtrA in vivo, linking metabolism to TCS signaling. Overall, we report that acetylation of RRs shields TCSs from crosstalk, modulates the phosphatase activities and alters the DNAbinding activities of RRs, all of which are non-intuitive behavior of TCS systems.},

abstract = {Serum resistance is a poorly understood but common trait of some difficult-to-treat pathogenic strains of bacteria. Here, we report that glycine, serine and threonine catabolic pathway is down-regulated in serum-resistant Escherichia coli, whereas exogenous glycine reverts the serum resistance and effectively potentiates serum to eliminate clinically-relevant bacterial pathogens in vitro and in vivo. We find that exogenous glycine increases the formation of membrane attack complex on bacterial membrane through two previously unrecognized regulations: 1) glycine negatively and positively regulates metabolic flux to purine biosynthesis and Krebs cycle, respectively. 2) $\alpha$-Ketoglutarate inhibits adenosine triphosphate synthase, which in together promote the formation of cAMP/CRP regulon to increase the expression of complement-binding proteins HtrE, NfrA, and YhcD. The results could lead to effective strategies for managing the infection with serum-resistant bacteria, an especially valuable approach for treating individuals with weak acquired immunity but a normal complement system.},

abstract = {Information transmission in biological signaling networks is commonly considered to be a unidirectional flow of information between protein partners. According to this view, many bacterial response regulator proteins utilize input receiver (REC) domains to “switch” functional outputs, using REC phosphorylation to shift pre-existing equilibria between inactive and active conformations. However, recent data indicate that output domains themselves also shift such equilibria, implying a “mutual inhibition” model. Here we use solution nuclear magnetic resonance to provide a mechanistic basis for such control in a PhyR-type response regulator. Our structure of the isolated, non-phosphorylated REC domain surprisingly reveals a fully active conformation, letting us identify structural and dynamic changes imparted by the output domain to inactivate the full-length protein. Additional data reveal transient structural changes within the full-length protein, facilitating activation. Our data provide a basis for understanding the changes that REC and output domains undergo to set a default “inactive” state.},

abstract = {Scaffolding proteins play important roles in supporting the plasma membrane (sarcolemma) of muscle cells. Among them, dystrophin strengthens the sarcolemma through protein-lipid interactions, and its absence due to gene mutations leads to the severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Most of the dystrophin protein consists of a central domain made of 24 spectrin- like coiled-coil repeats (R). Using small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and the contrast variation technique, we specifically probed the structure of the three first consecutive repeats 1–3 (R1–3), a part of dystrophin known to physiologically interact with membrane lipids. R1–3 free in solution was compared to its structure adopted in the presence of phospholipid-based bicelles. SANS data for the protein/lipid complexes were obtained with contrast-matched bicelles under various phospholipid compositions to probe the role of electrostatic interactions. When bound to anionic bicelles, large modifications of the protein threedimensional structure were detected, as revealed by a significant increase of the protein gyration radius from 42 5 1 to 60 5 4 A° . R1–3/anionic bicelle complexes were further analyzed by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. From these studies, we report an all-atom model of R1–3 that highlights the opening of the R1 coiled-coil repeat when bound to the membrane lipids. This model is totally in agreement with SANS and click chemistry/mass spectrometry data. We conclude that the sarcolemma membrane anchoring that occurs during the contraction/elongation process of muscles could be ensured by this coiled-coil opening. Therefore, understanding these structural changes may help in the design of rationalized shortened dystrophins for gene therapy. Finally, our strategy opens up new possibilities for structure determination of peripheral and integral membrane proteins not compatible with different high-resolution structural methods.},

To systematically determine molecular features that control its activity, here we analyze DNA-binding in vitro and genome-wide in vivo across different cell types with native or ectopic PU.1 expression. Although PU.1, in contrast to classical pioneer factors, is unable to access nucleosomal target sites in vitro, ectopic induction of PU.1 leads to the extensive remodeling of chromatin and redistribution of partner TFs. De novo chromatin access, stable binding, and redistribution of partner TFs both require PU.1's N-terminal acidic activation domain and its ability to recruit SWI/SNF remodeling complexes, suggesting that the latter may collect and distribute co-associated TFs in conjunction with the non-classical pioneer TF PU.1.},

abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 strains are highly resistant to opsonophagocytosis due to recruitment of the complement inhibitor Factor H via Hic, a member of the pneumococcal surface protein C (PspC) family. In this study, we demonstrated that Hic also interacts with vitronectin, a fluid-phase regulator involved in haemostasis, angiogenesis, and the terminal complement cascade as well as a component of the extracellular matrix. Blocking of Hic by specific antiserum or genetic deletion significantly reduced pneumococcal binding to soluble and immobilised vitronectin and to Factor H, respectively. In parallel, ectopic expression of Hic on the surface of Lactococcus lactis conferred binding to soluble and immobilised vitronectin as well as Factor H. Molecular analyses with truncated Hic fragments narrowed down the vitronectin-binding site to the central core of Hic (aa 151-201). This vitronectin-binding region is separate from that of Factor H, which binds to the N-terminus of Hic (aa 38-92). Binding of pneumococcal Hic was localised to the C-terminal heparin-binding domain (HBD3) of vitronectin. However, an N-terminal region to HBD3 was further involved in Hic-binding to immobilised vitronectin. Finally, vitronectin bound to Hic was functionally active and inhibited formation of the terminal complement complex. In conclusion, Hic interacts with vitronectin and simultaneously with Factor H, and both human proteins may contribute to colonisation and invasive disease caused by serotype 3 pneumococci.},

abstract = {The opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa controls host innate immune and complement attack. Here we identify Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (Lpd), a 57 kDa moonlighting protein, as the first P. aeruginosa protein that binds the two human terminal pathway inhibitors vitronectin and clusterin. Both human regulators when bound to the bacterium inhibited effector function of the terminal complement, blocked C5b-9 deposition and protected the bacterium from complement damage. P. aeruginosa when challenged with complement active human serum depleted from vitronectin was severely damaged and bacterial survival was reduced by over 50{\%}. Similarly, when in human serum clusterin was blocked by a mAb, bacterial survival was reduced by 44{\%}. Thus, demonstrating that Pseudomonas benefits from attachment of each human regulator and controls complement attack. The Lpd binding site in vitronectin was localized to the C-terminal region, i.e. to residues 354-363. Thus, Lpd of P. aeruginosa is a surface exposed moonlighting protein that binds two human terminal pathway inhibitors, vitronectin and clusterin and each human inhibitor when attached protected the bacterial pathogen from the action of the terminal complement pathway. Our results showed insights into the important function of Lpd as a complement regulator binding protein that might play an important role in virulence of P. aeruginosa.},

abstract = {Co-translational protein targeting to membranes depends on the regulated interaction of two ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs): the ribosome and the signal recognition particle (SRP). Human SRP is composed of an SRP RNA and six proteins with the SRP GTPase SRP54 forming the targeting complex with the heterodimeric SRP receptor (SR) at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. While detailed structural and functional data are available especially for the bacterial homologs, the analysis of human SRP was impeded by the unavailability of recombinant SRP. Here, we describe the large-scale production of all human SRP components and the reconstitution of homogeneous SRP and SR complexes. Binding to human ribosomes is determined by microscale thermophoresis for individual components, assembly intermediates and entire SRP, and binding affinities are correlated with structural information available for all ribosomal contacts. We show that SRP RNA does not bind to the ribosome, while SRP binds with nanomolar affinity involving a two-step mechanism of the key-player SRP54. Ultrasensitive binding of SRP68/72 indicates avidity by multiple binding sites that are dominated by the C-terminus of SRP72. Our data extend the experimental basis to understand the mechanistic principles of co-translational targeting in mammals and may guide analyses of complex RNP–RNP interactions in general.},

MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) is a rapid and precise method to quantify biomolecular interactions in solution at microliter scale. The basis of this technology is a physical effect referred to as thermophoresis, which describes the directed movement of molecules through temperature gradients. The thermophoretic properties of a molecule depend on its size, charge, and hydration shell. Since at least one of these parameters is altered upon binding of a ligand, this method can be used to analyze virtually any biomolecular interaction in any buffer or complex bioliquid. This section provides a detailed protocol describing how MST is used to obtain quantitative binding parameters for aptamer-target interactions. The two DNA-aptamers HD1 and HD22, which are targeted against human thrombin, are used as model systems to demonstrate a rapid and straightforward screening approach to determine optimal buffer conditions.},

For germination, Striga seeds require host-released strigolactones that are perceived by the family of HYPOSENSITIVE to LIGHT (ShHTL) receptors. Inhibiting seed germination would thus be a promising approach for combating Striga However, there are currently no strigolactone antagonists that specifically block ShHTLs and do not bind to DWARF14, the homologous strigolactone receptor of the host. Here, we show that the octyl phenol ethoxylate Triton X-100 inhibits S. hermonthica seed germination without affecting host plants. High-resolution X-ray structures reveal that Triton X-100 specifically plugs the catalytic pocket of ShHTL7. ShHTL7-specific inhibition by Triton X-100 demonstrates the dominant role of this particular ShHTL receptor for Striga germination. Our structural analysis provides a rationale for the broad specificity and high sensitivity of ShHTL7, and reveals that strigolactones trigger structural changes in ShHTL7 that are required for downstream signaling. Our findings identify Triton and the related 2-[4-(2,4,4-trimethylpentan-2-yl)phenoxy]acetic acid as promising lead compounds for the rational design of efficient Striga-specific herbicides.},

We are, however, limited in our understanding of the symbiosis signaling process. In particular, how membrane-localized receptors of legumes activate signal transduction following perception of rhizobial signaling molecules has mostly remained elusive. To address this, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation-based proteomics screen to identify proteins associated with Nod factor receptor 5 (NFR5) in Lotus japonicus. Out of 51 NFR5-associated proteins, we focused on a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK), which we named NFR5- interacting cytoplasmic kinase 4 (NiCK4). NiCK4 associates with heterologously expressed NFR5 in Nicotiana benthamiana, and directly binds and phosphorylates the cytoplasmic domains of NFR5 and NFR1 in vitro. At the cellular level, Nick4 is coexpressed with Nfr5 in root hairs and nodule cells, and the NiCK4 protein relocates to the nucleus in an NFR5/NFR1-dependent manner upon Nod factor treatment. Phenotyping of retrotransposon insertion mutants revealed that NiCK4 promotes nodule organogenesis. Together, these results suggest that the identified RLCK, NiCK4, acts as a component of the Nod factor signaling pathway downstream of NFR5.},

Comparative analysis with the previously identified $\beta$-glucan-binding lectin SiFGB1 demonstrated that whereas SiWSC3 does not require $\beta$1-6-linked glucose for efficient binding to branched $\beta$1-3-glucan, SiFGB1 does. In contrast to SiFGB1, the multivalent SiWSC3 lectin can efficiently agglutinate fungal cells and is additionally induced during fungus–fungus confrontation, suggesting different functions for these two $\beta$-glucan-binding lectins. Our results highlight the importance of the $\beta$-glucan cell wall component in plant–fungus interactions and the potential of $\beta$-glucan-binding lectins as specific detection tools for fungi in vivo.},

abstract = {Stem cells are one of the foundational evolutionary novelties that allowed the independent emergence of multicellularity in the plant and animal lineages. In plants, the homeodomain (HD) transcription factor WUSCHEL (WUS) is essential for the maintenance of stem cells in the shoot apical meristem. WUS has been reported to bind to diverse DNA motifs and to act as transcriptional activator and repressor. However, the mechanisms underlying this remarkable behavior have remained unclear. Here, we quantitatively delineate WUS binding to three divergent DNA motifs and resolve the relevant structural underpinnings. We show that WUS exhibits a strong binding preference for TGAA repeat sequences, while retaining the ability to weakly bind to TAAT elements. This behavior is attributable to the formation of dimers through interactions of specific residues in the HD that stabilize WUS DNA interaction. Our results provide a mechanistic basis for dissecting WUS dependent regulatory networks in plant stem cell control.},

abstract = {Calcium (Ca(2+)) signaling is a universal mechanism of signal transduction and involves Ca(2+) signal formation and decoding of information by Ca(2+) binding proteins. Calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs), which upon Ca(2+) binding activate CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) regulate a multitude of physiological processes in plants. Here, we combine phylogenomics and functional analyses to investigate the occurrence and structural conservation of CBL and CIPK proteins in 26 species representing all major clades of eukaryotes. We demonstrate the presence of at least singular CBL-CIPK pairs in representatives of Archaeplastida, Chromalveolates and Excavates and their general absence in Opisthokonta and Amoebozoa. This denotes CBL-CIPK complexes as evolutionary ancient Ca(2+) signaling modules that likely evolved in the ancestor of all Bikonta. Furthermore, we functionally characterize the CBLs and CIPK from the parabasalid human pathogen Trichomonas vaginalis. Our results reveal strict evolutionary conservation of functionally important structural features, preservation of biochemical properties and a remarkable cross-kingdom protein-protein interaction potential between CBLs and CIPKs from Arabidopsis thaliana and T. vaginalis. Together our findings suggest an ancient evolutionary origin of a functional CBL-CIPK signaling module close to the root of eukaryotic evolution and provide insights into the initial evolution of signaling networks and Ca(2+) signaling specificity.},

abstract = {Malaria parasites inevitably develop drug resistance to anti-malarials over time. Hence the immediacy for discovering new chemical scaffolds to include in combination malaria drug therapy. The desirable attributes of new chemotherapeutic agents currently include activity against both liver and blood stage malaria parasites. One such recently discovered compound called cladosporin abrogates parasite growth via inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum lysyl-tRNA synthetase (PfKRS), an enzyme central to protein translation. Here, we present crystal structure of ternary PfKRS-lysine-cladosporin (PfKRS-K-C) complex that reveals cladosporin's remarkable ability to mimic the natural substrate adenosine and thereby colonize PfKRS active site. The isocoumarin fragment of cladosporin sandwiches between critical adenine-recognizing residues while its pyran ring fits snugly in the ribose-recognizing cavity. PfKRS-K-C structure highlights ample space within PfKRS active site for further chemical derivatization of cladosporin. Such derivatives may be useful against additional human pathogens that retain high conservation in cladosporin chelating residues within their lysyl-tRNA synthetase.},
