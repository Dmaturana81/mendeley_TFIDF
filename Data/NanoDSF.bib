abstract = {Transcription Activator-Like Effectors (TALEs) of Xanthomonas bacteria are programmable DNA binding proteins with unprecedented target specificity. Comparative studies into TALE repeat structure and function are hindered by the limited sequence variation among TALE repeats. More sequence-diverse TALE-like proteins are known from Ralstonia solanacearum (RipTALs) and Burkholderia rhizoxinica (Bats), but RipTAL and Bat repeats are conserved with those of TALEs around the DNA-binding residue. We study two novel marine-organism TALE-like proteins (MOrTL1 and MOrTL2), the first to date of non-terrestrial origin. We have assessed their DNA-binding properties and modelled repeat structures. We found that repeats from these proteins mediate sequence specific DNA binding conforming to the TALE code, despite low sequence similarity to TALE repeats, and with novel residues around the BSR. However, MOrTL1 repeats show greater sequence discriminating power than MOrTL2 repeats. Sequence alignments show that there are only three residues conserved between repeats of all TALE-like proteins including the two new additions. This conserved motif could prove useful as an identifier for future TALE-likes. Additionally, comparing MOrTL repeats with those of other TALE-likes suggests a common evolutionary origin for the TALEs, RipTALs and Bats.},

Recently, nano differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) has emerged as a powerful tool for thermal stability analysis and studies of protein domain unfolding. Due to increased interests in the qualification of characterization methods, we are in this study presenting the qualification results for the comparability studies of thermal stability analysis using nanoDSF. The results show that nanoDSF is able to detect thermal transition signals for mAbs, BiTE{\textregistered} molecules, and cytokines at a wide concentration range with high precision, clearly indicating that nanoDSF is suitable for characterization including comparability studies of therapeutic proteins. Compared to the current recognized industry standard DSC, the nanoDSF method enables thermal stability analysis over a much wider concentration range, consumes considerably less materials, and provides significantly higher throughput.},

abstract = {Evaluating prospective protein pharmaceutical stability from accelerated screening is a critical challenge in biotherapeutic discovery and development. Measurements of protein unfolding transitions are widely employed for comparing candidate molecules and formulations; however, the interrelationships between intrinsic protein conformational stability and pharmaceutical robustness are complex and thermal unfolding measurements can be misleading. Beyond the discovery phase of drug development, astute formulation design is one of the most crucial factors enabling the protein to resist damage to its higher order structure - initially from bioprocessing stresses, then from stresses encountered during its journey from the product manufacturing site to the bloodstream of the patient. Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are multidomain proteins that represent a large and growing segment of the biotechnology pipeline. In this chapter, we describe how differential scanning calorimetry may be leveraged synergistically with isothermal chemical denaturation and intrinsic fluorescence with concomitant static light scattering to elucidate characteristics of mAb unfolding and aggregation that are helpful toward understanding and designing optimal pharmaceutical compositions for these molecules.},

High expression levels were observed in E. coli using the pETDuet-1 plasmid system in combination with an autoinduction protocol. A broad substrate scope ranging from aromatic to aliphatic carboxylic acids was tested and TtCAR showed activity for all substrates. High specific activities for aromatic substrates and short chain aliphatic substrates were observed, comparable to those of NcCAR, the first type III fungal CAR. TtCAR's pH and temperature optima were at 6.5 and 30 °C, respectively. Up to 20{\%} (v/v) cosolvents did not show a decrease in specific activity of TtCAR using (E)-cinnamic acid as a substrate. Its half-life at 40 °C was determined to be 8.25 h and its melting temperature (Tm) was 56 °C. In vitro reactions with TtCAR reduced 95.2{\%} of 10 mM vanillic acid, which correlated to a titer of 1.4 g L−1 of vanillin. The space time yield of 0.029 g L-1 h-1 indicates that further improvements would be necessary for an industrially relevant application. This would be especially important when competing against de novo synthesis of bio vanillin by microbial strains producing {\textgreater} 30 g L-1. In de novo and in vivo biosynthesis systems, by-products are fairly common. By contrast, we were pleased to observe less than 0.7{\%} of vanillyl alcohol formed, making the cell-free acid reduction in the envisaged sequential two-step bioconversion from eugenol to vanillin very attractive.},

abstract = {Heterokonts, Alveolata protists, green algae from Charophyta and Chlorophyta divisions, and all Embryophyta plants possess an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) gene named ALDH12. Here, we provide a biochemical characterization of two ALDH12 family members from the lower plant Physcomitrella patens and higher plant Zea mays. We show that ALDH12 encodes an NAD+-dependent glutamate $\gamma$-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (GSALDH), which irreversibly converts glutamate $\gamma$-semialdehyde (GSAL), a mitochondrial intermediate of the proline and arginine catabolism, to glutamate. Sedimentation equilibrium and small-angle X-ray scattering analyses reveal that in solution both plantGSALDHsexist as equilibrium between a domain-swapped dimer and the dimer-ofdimers tetramer. Plant GSALDHs share very low-sequence identity with bacterial, fungal, and animal GSALDHs (classified as ALDH4), which are the closest related ALDH superfamily members. Nevertheless, the crystal structure of ZmALDH12 at 2.2-{\AA} resolution shows that nearly all key residues involved in the recognition of GSAL are identical to those in ALDH4, indicating a close functional relationship with ALDH4. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the transition from ALDH4 to ALDH12 occurred during the evolution of the endosymbiotic plant ancestor, prior to the evolution of green algae and land plants. Finally, ALDH12 expression in maize and moss is downregulated in response to salt and drought stresses, possibly to maintain proline levels. Taken together, these results provide molecular insight into the biological roles of the plant ALDH12 family.},

We have studied structural transitions and functional stability of a Kunitz trypsin inhibitor from Chickpea (CaTI2), a potent insect gut-protease inhibitor, under different stress conditions like non-neutral pH, elevated temperature and co-solvent concentrations. CaTI2 was cloned and expressed in an eukaryotic system P. pastoris and was investigated for conformational transitions using circular dichroism spectroscopy, differential scanning fluorimetry and activity assay. Native CaTI2 has a sheet dominant structure with 40{\%} $\beta$ sheets and possess a single tryptophan residue situated in the hydrophobic core of the enzyme. The recombinant inhibitor maintained its maximum activity under alkaline pH with its secondary structure intact between pH 6–10. CaTI2 was observed to be thermally stable up to 55 °C with a Tm of 61.3 °C above which the protein unfolds. On treating with chemical denaturant (urea), the CaTI2 lost its inhibitory potential and native conformation beyond 2 M urea concentration. Moreover, the protein unfolded at lower temperatures as the concentration of denaturant increased, suggesting more complex structural changes. Further, the stability of the inhibitor was found to be directly proportional to the solvent polarity. The data, herein offers significant information of inhibitor stability and activity which could be exploited for its further development into an effective pesticide.

abstract = {Generation of high-affinity monoclonal antibodies by immunization of chickens is a valuable strategy, particularly for obtaining antibodies directed against epitopes that are conserved in mammals. A generic procedure is established for the humanization of chicken-derived antibodies. To this end, high-affinity binders of the epidermal growth factor receptor extracellular domain are isolated from immunized chickens using yeast surface display. Complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of two high-affinity binders are grafted onto a human acceptor framework. Simultaneously, Vernier zone residues, responsible for spatial CDR arrangement, are partially randomized. A yeast surface display library comprising ≈300 000 variants is screened for high-affinity binders in the scFv and Fab formats. Next-generation sequencing discloses humanized antibody variants with restored affinity and improved protein characteristics compared to the parental chicken antibodies. Furthermore, the sequencing data give new insights into the importance of antibody format, used during the humanization process. Starting from the antibody repertoire of immunized chickens, this work features an effective and fast high-throughput approach for the generation of multiple humanized antibodies with potential therapeutic relevance.},

abstract = {Nanobodies represent the variable binding domain of camelid heavy-chain antibodies and are employed in a rapidly growing range of applications in biotechnology and biomedicine. Their success is based on unique properties including their reported ability to reversibly refold after heat-induced denaturation. This view, however, is contrasted by studies which involve irreversibly aggregating nanobodies, asking for a quantitative analysis that clearly defines nanobody thermoresistance and reveals the determinants of unfolding reversibility and aggregation propensity. By characterizing nearly 70 nanobodies, we show that irreversible aggregation does occur upon heat denaturation for the large majority of binders, potentially affecting application-relevant parameters like stability and immunogenicity. However, by deriving aggregation propensities from apparent melting temperatures, we show that an optional disulfide bond suppresses nanobody aggregation. This effect is further enhanced by increasing the length of a complementarity determining loop which, although expected to destabilize, contributes to nanobody stability. The effect of such variations depends on environmental conditions, however. Nanobodies with two disulfide bonds, for example, are prone to lose their functionality in the cytosol. Our study suggests strategies to engineer nanobodies that exhibit optimal performance parameters and gives insights into general mechanisms which evolved to prevent protein aggregation.},

abstract = {Streptomyces mobaraensis produces the papain inhibitor SPI consisting of a 12 kDa protein and small active compounds (SPIac). Purification of the papain inhibitory compounds resulted in four diverse chymostatin derivatives that were characterized by NMR and MS analysis. Chymostatins are hydrophobic tetrapeptide aldehydes from streptomycetes, e.g., S. lavendulae and S. hygroscopicus, that reverse chymosin-mediated angiotensin activation and inhibit other serine and cysteine proteases. Chymotrypsin and papain were both inhibited by the SPIac compounds in the low nanomolar range. SPIac differs from the characterized chymostatins by the exchange of phenylalanine for tyrosine. The crystal structure of one of these chymostatin variants confirmed its molecular structure and revealed a S-configured hemithioacetal bond with the catalytic Cys25 thiolate as well as close interactions with hydrophobic S1 and S2 subsite amino acids. A model for chymostatin biosynthesis is provided based on the discovery of clustered genes encoding several putative nonribosomal peptide synthetases; among them, there is the unusual CstF enzyme that accommodates two canonical amino acid activation domains as well as three peptide carrier protein domains.},

The present article reports on a fast-track assessment platform for rapid investigation of therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with minimal sample concentration, volume, and preparation. The proposed nanoDSF platform has been demonstrated for rapid assessment of two commercial IgG 1 drug products (DP), trastuzumab and rituximab, and their biosimilars with respect to their conformational and colloidal stability. Domain specific differences for each of the IgGs have been elucidated with respect to onset of domain unfolding (Tonset) and melting temperatures. These thermal unfolding and transition midpoint (Tm) measurements are based on the intrinsic aromatic amino acid residue fluorescence of proteins. Moreover, to understand the possibility of nanoDSF as a predictive tool, data from nanoDSF has been correlated with accelerated stability studies. Melting temperatures across brands were found to be highly comparable to the rate of heating, thereby exhibiting a significant domain specific effect on melting temperatures for both trastuzumab and rituximab. Conservation of higher order structure (HOS) through reversible unfolding was also examined and both the mAbs were found to regain tertiary structure up till the first transition midpoint. No clear correlation was found between formation of higher molecular weight species (HMWS) and unfolding parameters (Tonset and Tagg) for accelerated stability studies. Finally, a discussion on the need for fast predictive assessment of conformation and colloidal stability as well as a comparison of advantages and limitations of the technique with routine/classical tools such as circular dichroism spectrophotometry and differential scanning calorimetry has been presented.},

Here, we establish a simple, high-throughput screening method to identify optimal detergent conditions for membrane protein stabilization. We apply differential scanning fluorimetry in combination with scattering upon thermal denaturation to study the unfolding of integral membrane proteins. Nine different prokaryotic and eukaryotic membrane proteins were used as test cases to benchmark our detergent screening method. Our results show that it is possible to measure the stability and solubility of IMPs by diluting them from their initial solubilization condition into different detergents. We were able to identify groups of detergents with characteristic stabilization and destabilization effects for selected targets. We further show that fos-choline and PEG family detergents may lead to membrane protein destabilization and unfolding. Finally, we determined thenmodynamic parameters that are important indicators of IMP stability. The described protocol allows the identification of conditions that are suitable for downstream handling of membrane proteins during purification.},

abstract = {Biotransformations in organic chemistry frequently suffer from limitations caused by low water-solubility of substrates and product inhibition. Both, usually are addressed by the addition of organic cosolvents, which often accompanies at the expense of enzyme stability. A common method for measuring enzyme stability is to determine the melting temperature (Tm) of the enzyme. However, current methods are limited to the application of purified enzymes. Herein, for the first time, an easy and fast ({\textless}1 h) high-throughput feasible method to determine enzyme stabilities directly from crude extracts is reported. In pure buffer, the Tm value measured in the crude extract was identical to that obtained for the purified enzyme. Through the addition of different organic compounds, the Tm values in the crude extract differed by up to 2.4 8C from that of the purified enzymes due to the presence of the host-cell proteins. Thus, the measurement of enzyme stabilities in crude extracts appears to represent conditions in whole-cell catalysts even better. The applied nano differential scanning fluorimetry technology is further proven to be suitable for whole-cell catalysts with two overexpressed enzymes; thus representing a tool for the rapid screening of natural and mutant enzyme libraries in terms of process stability for challenging biotransformations.},

In eukaryotes the SLC35 family of solute carriers are responsible for their selective uptake into the Endoplasmic Reticulum or Golgi apparatus. The structure of the yeast GDP-mannose transporter, Vrg4, revealed a requirement for short chain lipids and a marked difference in transport rate between the nucleotide sugar and nucleoside monophosphate, suggesting a complex network of regulatory elements control transport into these organelles. Here we report the crystal structure of the GMP bound complex of Vrg4, revealing the molecular basis for GMP recognition and transport. Molecular dynamics, combined with biochemical analysis, reveal a lipid mediated dimer interface and mechanism for coordinating structural rearrangements during transport. Together these results provide further insight into how SLC35 family transporters function within the secretory pathway and sheds light onto the role that membrane lipids play in regulating transport across the membrane.},

abstract = {One of the major challenges in formulation development of biopharmaceuticals is improving long-term storage stability, which is often achieved by addition of excipients to the final formulation. Finding the optimal excipient for a given protein is usually done using a trial-and-error approach, due to the lack of general understanding of how excipients work for a particular protein. Previously, preferential interactions (binding or exclusion) of excipients with proteins were postulated as a mechanism explaining diversity in the stabilisation effects. Weak preferential binding is however difficult to quantify experimentally, and the question remains whether the formulation process should seek excipients which preferentially bind with proteins, or not. Here, we apply solution NMR spectroscopy to comprehensively evaluate protein-excipient interactions between therapeutically relevant proteins and commonly used excipients. Additionally, we evaluate the effect of excipients on thermal and colloidal protein stability, on aggregation kinetics and protein storage stability at elevated temperatures. We show that there is a weak negative correlation between the strength of protein-excipient interactions and effect on enhancing protein thermal stability. We found that the overall protein-excipient binding per se can be a poor criterion for choosing excipients enhancing formulation stability. Experiments on a diverse set of excipients and test proteins reveal that while excipients affect all of the different aspects of protein stability, the effects are very much protein specific, and care must be taken to avoid apparent generalisations if a smaller dataset is being used.},

abstract = {During the early stages of infection, the HIV-1 capsid protects viral components from cytosolic sensors and nucleases such as cGAS and TREX, respectively, while allowing access to nucleotides for efficient reverse transcription1. Here we show that each capsid hexamer has a size-selective pore bound by a ring of six arginine residues and a ‘molecular iris' formed by the amino-terminal $\beta$-hairpin. The arginine ring creates a strongly positively charged channel that recruits the four nucleotides with on-rates that approach diffusion limits. Progressive removal of pore arginines results in a dose-dependent and concomitant decrease in nucleotide affinity, reverse transcription and infectivity. This positively charged channel is universally conserved in lentiviral capsids despite the fact that it is strongly destabilizing without nucleotides to counteract charge repulsion. We also describe a channel inhibitor, hexacarboxybenzene, which competes for nucleotide binding and efficiently blocks encapsidated reverse transcription, demonstrating the tractability of the pore as a novel drug target.},

Our previous work showed that a specific residue position on transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) in class A GPCRs consistently yields thermostable mutants. The crystal structure of human chemokine receptor CCR5 also showed increased thermostability upon mutation of two positions, A233D6.33 and K303E7.59. With the goal of testing the transferability of these two thermostabilizing mutations in other chemokine receptors, we tested the mutations A237D6.33 and R307E7.59 in human CCR3 for thermostability and aggregation properties in detergent solution. Interestingly, the double mutant exhibited a 6–10-fold decrease in the aggregation propensity of the wild-type protein. This is in stark contrast to the two single mutants whose aggregation properties resemble the wild type (WT). Moreover, unlike in CCR5, the two single mutants separately showed no increase in thermostability c...},

Our models have been trained on therapeutic relevant proteins, including monoclonal antibodies, in various pharmaceutically relevant formulations. Further, we developed network architectures with good prediction power using the least amount of input features, i.e. experimental effort to train the network. This provides an empiric means to highlight the most important parameters in the prediction of real-time protein stability. Further, several models were developed by a different validation means (i.e. leave-one-protein-out cross-validation) to test the robustness and the limitations of our approach. Finally, we apply surrogate machine learning algorithms (e.g. linear regression) to build trust in the ANNs decision making procedure and to highlight the connection between the leading inputs and the outputs.},

Current electrical sensing devices are based on either membrane protein pores supported in planar lipid bilayers or solid-state (SS) pores fabricated in thin metallic membranes. While both types of nanosensors have been used in a variety of applications, each has inherent disadvantages that limit its use. Hybrid nanopores, consisting of a protein pore supported within a SS membrane, combine the robust nature of SS membranes with the precise and simple engineering of protein nanopores. We demonstrate here a novel lipid-free hybrid nanopore comprising a natural DNA pore from a thermostable virus, electrokinetically inserted into a larger nanopore supported in a silicon nitride membrane. The hybrid pore is stable and easy to fabricate, and, most importantly, exhibits low peripheral leakage allowing sensing and discrimination among different types of biomolecules.},

Here, we determined the structures of a eukaryotic Nav channel alone and in complex with a lethal $\alpha$-scorpion toxin, AaH2, by electron microscopy, both at 3.5-A resolution. AaH2 wedges into voltage-sensor domain IV (VSD4) to impede fast activation by trapping a deactivated state in which gating charge interactions bridge to the acidic intracellular C-terminal domain. In the absence of AaH2, the S4 helix of VSD4 undergoes a {\~{}}13-{\AA} translation to unlatch the intracellular fast inactivation gating machinery. Highlighting the polypharmacology of $\alpha$-scorpion toxins, AaH2 also targets an unanticipated receptor site on VSD1 and a pore-glycan adjacent to VSD4. Overall, this work provides key insights into fast inactivation, electromechanical coupling, and pathogenic mutations in Nav channels.},

abstract = {Bispecific antibodies come in many different formats, including the particularly interesting two-in-one antibodies, where one conventional IgG binds two different antigens. The IgG format allows these antibodies to mediate Fc-related functionality, and their wild-type structure ensures low immunogenicity and enables standard methods to be used for development. It is however difficult, time-consuming and costly to generate two-in-one antibodies. Herein we demonstrate a new approach to create a similar type of antibody by combining two different variable heavy (VH) domains in each Fab arm of an IgG, a tetra-VH IgG format. The VHs are used as building blocks, where one VH is placed at its usual position, and the second VH replaces the variable light (VL) domain in a conventional IgG. VH domains, binding several different types of antigens, were discovered and could be rearranged in any combination, offering a convenient “plug and play” format. The tetra-VH IgGs were found to be functionally tetravalent, binding two antigens on each arm of the IgG molecule simultaneously. This offers a new strategy to also create monospecific, tetravalent IgGs that, depending on antigen architecture and mode-of-action, may have enhanced efficacy compared to traditional bivalent antibodies.},

A homozygous hypomorphic mutation in human OTULIN causes a potentially fatal autoinflammatory condition termed OTULIN-related autoinflammatory syndrome (ORAS). Four independent OTULIN mouse models reveal that OTULIN deficiency in immune cells results in cell-type-specific effects, ranging from over-production of inflammatory cytokines and autoimmunity due to accumulation of M1-linked polyubiquitin and spontaneous NF-??B activation in myeloid cells to downregulation of M1-polyubiquitin signaling by degradation of LUBAC in B and T??cells. Remarkably, treatment with anti-TNF neutralizing antibodies ameliorates inflammation in ORAS patients and rescues mouse phenotypes. Hence, OTULIN is critical for restraining??life-threatening spontaneous inflammation and maintaining immune homeostasis.},

The melting temperatures observed for the native Cprot and for the enzyme treated under various stress conditions correlated well with the corresponding structural and functional transitions obtained. The structural information was supported by the homology model of its closest homologue from C. coronatus; revealing its similarity to PA clan of proteases (Proteases of mixed nucleophile, superfamily A), with His-64, Asp-113 and Ser-208 as putative catalytic triad.

These characteristics were tackled by combining successive rounds of epPCR along with semi‐rational mutagenesis leading to a triple mutant (Thal‐GLV) with substantially increased thermostability (∆T M = 23.5 K) and higher activity at 25 °C than the wild type enzyme. Moreover, an active‐site mutation has a striking impact on thermostability but also on enantioselectivity. Our data contribute to a detailed understanding of biohalogenation and provide a profound basis for future engineering strategies to facilitate chemoenzymatic application of these attractive biocatalysts.},

abstract = {The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer is located on the surface of the virus and is the target of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). Recombinant native-like soluble Env trimer mimetics, such as SOSIP trimers, have taken a central role in HIV-1 vaccine research aimed at inducing bNAbs. We therefore performed a direct and thorough comparison of a full-length unmodified Env trimer containing the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail, with the sequence matched soluble SOSIP trimer, both based on an early Env sequence (AMC011) from an HIV+ individual that developed bNAbs. The structures of the full-length AMC011 trimer bound to either bNAb PGT145 or PGT151 were very similar to the structures of SOSIP trimers. Antigenically, the full-length and SOSIP trimers were comparable, but in contrast to the full-length trimer, the SOSIP trimer did not bind at all to non-neutralizing antibodies, most likely as a consequence of the intrinsic stabilization of the SOSIP trimer. Furthermore, the glycan composition of full-length and SOSIP trimers was similar overall, but the SOSIP trimer possessed slightly less complex and less extensively processed glycans, which may relate to the intrinsic stabilization as well as the absence of the membrane tether. These data provide insights into how to best use and improve membrane-associated full-length and soluble SOSIP HIV-1 Env trimers as immunogens.},

abstract = {In antibody light chain amyloidosis (AL), mutant light chains (LCs) or their variable domains (VLs) form fibrils, which accumulate in organs and lead to their failure. The molecular mechanism of this disease is still poorly understood. One of the key open issues is whether the mutant VLs and LCs differ in fibril formation. We addressed this question studying the effects of the VL mutations S20N and R61A within the isolated VL domain and in the fulllength LC scaffold. Both VL variants readily form fibrils. Here, we find that in the LC context, the S20N variant is protected from fibril formation while for LC R61A fibril formation is even accelerated compared to VL R61A. Our analyses revealed that the partially unfolded state of the VL R61A domain destabilizes the CL domain by non-native interactions, in turn leading to a further unfolding of the VL domain. In contrast, the folded mutant VL S20N and VL wt form native interactions with CL. These are beneficial for LC stability and promote amyloid resistance. Thus the effects of specific mutations on the VL fold can have opposing effects on LC domain interactions, stability and amyloidogenicity.},

Moisture loss or gain from one region or food component to another region will continuously occur in order to reach thermodynamic equilibrium with the surrounding food components and the environment. Two main factors influencing the amount and rate of moisture migration are water activity equilibrium (thermodynamics) and factors affecting the diffusion rate (dynamics of mass transfer). Adding an edible layer between domains, changing the water activity of the food ingredients, changing the effective diffusivity of the water, and changing the viscosity (molecular mobility) in the entrapped amorphous phases are several means to control water migration between domains in food systems.},

abstract = {Interactions between metabolites and proteins play an integral role in all cellular functions. Here we describe an affinity purification (AP) approach in combination with LC/MS-based metabolomics and proteomics that allows, to our knowledge for the first time, analysis of protein-metabolite and protein-protein interactions simultaneously in plant systems. More specifically, we examined protein and small-molecule partners of the three (of five) nucleoside diphosphate kinases present in the Arabidopsis genome (NDPK1-NDPK3). The bona fide role of NDPKs is the exchange of terminal phosphate groups between nucleoside diphosphates (NDPs) and triphosphates (NTPs). However, other functions have been reported, which probably depend on both the proteins and small molecules specifically interacting with the NDPK. Using our approach we identified 23, 17, and 8 novel protein partners of NDPK1, NDPK2, and NDPK3, respectively, with nucleotide-dependent proteins such as actin and adenosine kinase 2 being enriched. Particularly interesting, however, was the co-elution of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and reduced glutathione (GSH) with the affinity-purified NDPK1 complexes. Following up on this finding, we could demonstrate that NDPK1 undergoes glutathionylation, opening a new paradigm of NDPK regulation in plants. The described results extend our knowledge of NDPKs, the key enzymes regulating NDP/NTP homeostasis.},

abstract = {Testis-restricted melanoma antigen (MAGE) proteins are frequently hijacked in cancer and play a critical role in tumorigenesis. MAGEs assemble with E3 ubiquitin ligases and function as substrate adaptors that direct the ubiquitination of novel targets, including key tumor suppressors. However, how MAGEs recognize their targets is unknown and has impeded the development of MAGE-directed therapeutics. Here, we report the structural basis for substrate recognition by MAGE ubiquitin ligases. Biochemical analysis of the degron motif recognized by MAGE-A11 and the crystal structure of MAGE-A11 bound to the PCF11 substrate uncovered a conserved substrate binding cleft (SBC) in MAGEs. Mutation of the SBC disrupted substrate recognition by MAGEs and blocked MAGE-A11 oncogenic activity. A chemical screen for inhibitors of MAGE-A11:substrate interaction identified 4-Aminoquinolines as potent inhibitors of MAGE-A11 that show selective cytotoxicity. These findings provide important insights into the large family of MAGE ubiquitin ligases and identify approaches for developing cancer-specific therapeutics.},

Subsequently, the virophage-encoded protease processes the major capsid protein to prepare virions for infection.},

abstract = {Citrullination is an essential post-translational modification in which the guanidinium group of protein and peptide arginines is deiminated by peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs). When deregulated, excessive citrullination leads to inflammation as in severe periodontal disease (PD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Porphyromonas gingivalis is the major periodontopathogenic causative agent of PD and also an etiological agent of RA. It secretes a PAD, termed Porphyromonas PAD (PPAD), which is a virulence factor that causes aberrant citrullination. Analysis of P. gingivalis genomes of laboratory strains and clinical isolates unveiled a PPAD variant (PPAD-T2), which showed three amino-acid substitutions directly preceding catalytic Residue H236 (G231 N/E232 T/N235 D) when compared with PPAD from the reference strain (PPAD-T1). Mutation of these positions in the reference strain resulted in twofold higher cell-associated citrullinating activity. Similar to PPAD-T1, recombinant PPAD-T2 citrullinated arginines at the C-termini of general peptidic substrates but not within peptides. Catalytically, PPAD-T2 showed weaker substrate binding but higher turnover rates than PPAD-T1. In contrast, no differences were found in thermal stability. The 1.6 {\AA}-resolution X-ray crystal structure of PPAD-T2 in complex with the general human PAD inhibitor, Cl-amidine, revealed that the inhibitor moiety is tightly bound and that mutations localize to a loop engaged in substrate/inhibitor binding. In particular, mutation G231 N caused a slight structural rearrangement, which probably originated the higher substrate turnover observed. The present data compare two natural PPAD variants and will set the pace for the design of specific inhibitors against P. gingivalis-caused PD.},

Understanding protein-nanoparticle interactions in the blood stream is of major importance due to their potential risks, especially immunogenicity (i.e. the ability to induce an immune response). Here, we report on the interaction of superparamagnetic maghemite ($\gamma$-Fe2O3) nanoparticles with human blood plasma protein transferrin presenting different iron-saturation levels: partially iron-saturated (i.e. transferrin) and iron-free transferrin (i.e. apotransferrin). The nanoparticle-protein interaction and the protein corona formation were studied using biophysical and chemical approaches based on dynamic light scattering, gel electrophoresis, circular dichroism spectroscopy and differential scanning fluorimetry. We found that iron content governs the protein corona formation and induces a strong effect on the thermal stability of the bound protein. Our results demonstrate a stabilizing effect of the nanoparticles with a change of the unfolding position of approximately 10 °C towards higher temperatures for transferrin. Our study may be relevant for the further development of magnetic nanoparticles as diagnostic and therapeutic tools.},

They gave rise to an entire spectrum of applications in biotechnology, research and medicine. Despite several reports about reversibly refolding nanobodies, protein aggregation plays a major role in nanobody thermoresistance, asking for strategies to engineer their refolding behavior. Here, we use measurements of nanobody aggregation kinetics to validate structural features in the nanobody fold that are suppressing heat-induced nanobody aggregation. Furthermore, the kinetic measurements yielded a detailed insight into the concept of the $\Delta$Tm shift, a metric for protein aggregation propensities obtained from differential scanning fluorimetry measurements. By relating the equilibrium measurements of the $\Delta$Tm shift to the kinetic measurements of heat-induced nanobody aggregation, a distinct relationship could be identified that allows a prediction of nanobody aggregation rates from a simple equilibrium measurement of $\Delta$Tm.},

abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies play an increasingly important role for the development of new drugs across multiple therapy areas. The term 'developability' encompasses the feasibility of molecules to successfully progress from discovery to development via evaluation of their physicochemical properties. These properties include the tendency for self-interaction and aggregation, thermal stability, colloidal stability, and optimization of their properties through sequence engineering. Selection of the best antibody molecule based on biological function, efficacy, safety, and developability allows for a streamlined and successful CMC phase. An efficient and practical high-throughput developability workflow (100 s-1,000 s of molecules) implemented during early antibody generation and screening is crucial to select the best lead candidates. This involves careful assessment of critical developability parameters, combined with binding affinity and biological properties evaluation using small amounts of purified material ({\textless}1 mg), as well as an efficient data management and database system. Herein, a panel of 152 various human or humanized monoclonal antibodies was analyzed in biophysical property assays. Correlations between assays for different sets of properties were established. We demonstrated in two case studies that physicochemical properties and key assay endpoints correlate with key downstream process parameters. The workflow allows the elimination of antibodies with suboptimal properties and a rank ordering of molecules for further evaluation early in the candidate selection process. This enables any further engineering for problematic sequence attributes without affecting program timelines.},

abstract = {Sec1/Munc18 proteins play a key role in initiating the assembly of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes, the molecular fusion machinery. Employing comparative structure modeling, site specific crosslinking by single amino acid substitutions with the photoactivatable unnatural amino acid benzoylphenylalanine (BPA) and reconstituted vesicle docking/fusion assays, we mapped the binding interface between Munc18-1 and the neuronal v-SNARE VAMP2 with single amino acid resolution. Our results show that helices 11 and 12 of domain 3a in Munc18-1 interact with the VAMP2 SNARE motif covering the region from layers -4 to +5. Residue Q301 in helix 11 plays a pivotal role in VAMP2 binding and template complex formation. A VAMP2 binding deficient mutant, Munc18-1 Q301D, does not stimulate lipid mixing in a reconstituted fusion assay. The neuronal SNARE-organizer Munc13-1, which also binds VAMP2, does not bypass the requirement for the Munc18-1{\textperiodcentered}VAMP2 interaction. Importantly, Munc18-1 Q301D expression in Munc18-1 deficient neurons severely reduces synaptic transmission, demonstrating the physiological significance of the Munc18-1{\textperiodcentered}VAMP2 interaction.},

abstract = {Two ternary sol-gel matrices, an octyltriethoxysilane-based aliphatic matrix and a phenyltriethoxysilane (PTEOS)-based aromatic matrix, were used to immobilize a methanol-stable variant of lipase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus T6 for the synthesis of biodiesel from waste oil. Superior thermal stability of the mutant versus the wildtype in methanol was confirmed by intrinsic protein fluorescence measurements. The influence of skim milk and soluble E. coli lysate proteins as bulking and stabilizing agents in conjunction with sol-gel entrapment were investigated. E. coli lysate proteins were better stabilizing agents of the purified lipase mutant than skim milk, as evidenced by reverse engineering of the aromatic-based system. This was also shown for commercial Candida antarctica lipase B (CaLB) and Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLL). Uniform, dense, and nonaggregated particles imaged by scanning electron microscopy and a small particle size of 13 $\mu$m pertaining to the system comprising PTEOS and E. coli lysate proteins correlated well with high esterification activity. Combining protein and immobilization engineering resulted in a durable biocatalyst with efficient recycling ability and high biodiesel conversion rates.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making the development of effectiveTB vaccines a global priority. A TB vaccine consisting of a recombinant fusion protein, H4, combined witha novel synthetic cationic adjuvant, IC31{\textregistered}, is currently being developed. The H4 fusion protein consistsof two immunogenic mycobacterial antigens, Ag85 B and TB10.4, and the IC31{\textregistered}adjuvant is a mixture ofKLK, a leucine-rich peptide (KLKL5KLK), and the oligodeoxynucleotide ODN1a, a TLR9 ligand. However,efficient and robust methods for assessing these formulated components are lacking. Here, we developedand optimized phase analysis light scattering (PALS), electrical sensing zone (ESZ), and Raman, FTIR, andCD spectroscopy methods to characterize the H4-IC31 vaccine formulation. PALS-measured conductiv-ity and zeta potential values could differentiate between the similarly sized particles of IC31{\textregistered}adjuvantand the H4-IC31 vaccine candidate and could thereby serve as a control during vaccine formulation. Inaddition, zeta potential is indicative of the adjuvant to antigen ratio which is the key in the immunomod-ulatory response of the vaccine. ESZ was used as an orthogonal method to measure IC31{\textregistered}and H4-IC31particle sizes. Raman, FTIR, and CD spectroscopy revealed structural changes in H4 protein and IC31{\textregistered}adjuvant, inducing an increase in both the -sheet and random coil content as a result of adsorption.Furthermore, nanoDSF showed changes in the tertiary structure of H4 protein as a result of adjuvanta-tion to IC31{\textregistered}. Our findings demonstrate the applicability of biophysical methods to characterize vaccinecomponents in the final H4-IC31 drug product without the requirement for desorption.},

abstract = {The extreme durability of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) debris has rendered it a long-term environmental burden. At the same time, current recycling efforts still lack sustainability. Two recently discovered bacterial enzymes that specifically degrade PET represent a promising solution. First, Ideonella sakaiensis PETase, a structurally well-characterized consensus $\alpha$/$\beta$-hydrolase fold enzyme, converts PET to mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET). MHETase, the second key enzyme, hydrolyzes MHET to the PET educts terephthalate and ethylene glycol. Here, we report the crystal structures of active ligand-free MHETase and MHETase bound to a nonhydrolyzable MHET analog. MHETase, which is reminiscent of feruloyl esterases, possesses a classic $\alpha$/$\beta$-hydrolase domain and a lid domain conferring substrate specificity. In the light of structure-based mapping of the active site, activity assays, mutagenesis studies and a first structure-guided alteration of substrate specificity towards bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) reported here, we anticipate MHETase to be a valuable resource to further advance enzymatic plastic degradation.},

abstract = {Identification of molecular liabilities and implementation of mitigation strategies are key aspects that need to be considered by pharmaceutical companies developing therapeutic proteins. In the field of monoclonal antibodies, an efficient and streamlined process known as developability assessment is used for the selection of the "fittest" candidate. Other protein modalities, have in most cases only a limited number of possible candidates, requiring a paradigm change to a concept of candidate enabling. The assessment of liabilities at early project phases with the possibility to re-engineer candidates becomes essential for the success of these projects. Each protein possesses a unique stability profile resulting from the interplay of conformational, colloidal, chemical and physical stability attributes. All of these attributes strongly depend on external factors. Conformational and colloidal stability profiles of three non-immunoglobulin domain based proteins, namely Carbonic anhydrase, Ovalbumin and Thyroglobulin, and of two monoclonal antibodies were assessed in dependence of solution pH, ionic strength and varying buffering agents. The impact of screened external factors on proteins' stability attributes varied significantly, indicating presence of molecule specific liabilities. Screening of such a broad space of conditions at early project phases is only feasible using low-material consuming, high-throughput analytical methods as exemplified in this study.},

abstract = {Coformulations containing two therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could offer various benefits like enhanced therapeutic efficacy and better patient compliance. However, there are very few published studies on coformulations and binary mixtures of mAbs. It remains unclear to what extent mAbs with different physicochemical properties can be combined in solution without detrimental effects on protein stability. Here, we present a study including six model mAbs of the IgG1 subclass that are commercially available. In silico and biophysical characterization shows that the proteins have different physicochemical properties. Thus, their combinations represent various scenarios for coformulation development. We prepared all possible binary mixtures of the six mAbs and determined several biophysical parameters that are assessed during early-stage protein drug product development. The measured biophysical parameters are indicative of the conformational protein stability (inflection points of the thermal protein unfolding transitions) and the colloidal protein stability (aggregation onset temperatures and interaction parameter kD from dynamic light scattering). Remarkably, all 15 binary mAb mixtures do not exhibit biophysical parameters that indicate inferior conformational or colloidal stability compared to the least stable mAb in the mixture. Our findings suggest that the coformulation of some therapeutic monoclonal antibodies of the IgG1 subclass could be possible in a straightforward way as severe detrimental effects on the stability of these proteins in binary mixtures were not observed.

In this study, using tandem mass spectrometry, we have identified specific lipids associated with the Escherichia coli ABC transporter McjD, which translocates the antibacterial peptide MccJ25. Using non-denaturing mass spectrometry, we show that McjD in complex with MccJ25 survives the gas phase. Partial delipidation of McjD resulted in reduced ATPase activity and thermostability as shown by circular dichroism, both of which could be restored upon addition of defined E. coli lipids. We have resolved a phosphatidylglycerol lipid associated with McjD at 3.4 {\AA} resolution, whereas molecular dynamic simulations carried out in different lipid environments assessed the binding of specific lipids to McjD. Combined, our data show a synergistic effect of zwitterionic and negatively charged lipids on the activity of McjD; the zwitterionic lipids provide structural stability to McjD, whereas the negatively charged lipids are essential for its function.},

Ertiprotafib is a PTP1B inhibitor that reached the clinical trial stage for the treatment of diabetes. Interestingly, Ertiprotafib reduces the melting temperature of PTP1B in differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) assays, different from most drugs that increase the stability of their target upon binding. No molecular data on how Ertiprotafib functions has been published. Thus, to gain molecular insights into the mode of action of Ertiprotafib, we used biomolecular NMR spectroscopy to characterize the molecular details of the PTP1B:Ertiprotafib interaction. Our results show that Ertiprotafib induces aggregation of PTP1B in a concentration dependent manner. This shows that the insufficient clinical efficacy and adverse effects caused by Ertiprotafib is due to its tendency to cause aggregation of PTP1B.},

abstract = {Enzymes are attractive tools for synthetic applications. To be viable for industrial use enzymes need sufficient stability towards the desired reaction conditions such as high substrate and cosolvent concentration, non-neutral pH and elevated temperatures. Thermal stability is an attractive feature not only because it allows for protein purification by thermal treatment and higher process temperatures, but also due to the associated higher stability against other destabilising factors. Therefore, highthroughput screening methods are desirable for the identification of thermostable biocatalysts by discovery from nature or by protein engineering but current methods have low throughput and require time-demanding purification of protein samples. We found that nanoscale differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) is a valuable tool to rapidly and reliably determine melting points of native proteins. To avoid intrinsic problems posed by crude protein extracts, hypotonic extraction of overexpressed protein from bacterial host cells resulted in higher sample quality and accurate manual determination of several hundred melting temperatures per day. We have probed the use of nanoDSF for high-throughput screening of a phylogenetically diverse aldolase library to identify novel thermostable enzymes from metagenomic sources and for the rapid measurements of variants from saturation mutagenesis. The feasibility of nanoDSF for the screening of synthetic reaction conditions was proved by studies of co-solvent tolerance, which showed protein melting temperature to decrease linearly with increasing cosolvent concentration for all combinations of six enzymes and eight watermiscible cosolvents investigated, and of substrate affinity, which showed stabilization of hexokinase by sugars in the absence of ATP cofactor.},

abstract = {Males of the parasitic wasp genus Nasonia use blends of chiral hydroxylactones as sex pheromones to attract conspecific females. Whereas all Nasonia species use a mixture of (4R,5S)-5-hydroxy-4- decanolide (RS) and 4-methylquinazoline (MQ) as sex pheromones, Nasonia vitripennis evolved (4R,5R)-5-hydroxy-4-decanolide (RR) as an extra sex pheromone component. We recently identified and functionally characterized three short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) NV10127, NV10128, and NV10129 that are capable of catalyzing the epimerization of RS to RR via (4R)-5-oxo-4-decanolide (ODL) as intermediate. Despite their very high sequence identities of 88–98{\%}, these proteins differ drastically in their ability to epimerize RS to RR and in their stereoselectivity when reducing ODL to RR/ RS. Here, in order to unravel the sequence differences underlying these varying functional properties of NV1027, NV10128 and NV10129, we created chimeras of the three enzymes and monitored their catalytic activities in vitro. The results show that a few amino acid changes at the C-termini and active sites of Nasonia vitripennis SDRs lead to substantially altered RS to RR epimerization and ODLreduction activities. Thus, our study adds to the understanding of pheromone evolution by showing that subtle mutations in key biosynthetic enzymes can result in drastic effects on the composition of chemical signals.},

The receptor responsible for succinate signalling, SUCNR1 (also known as GPR91), is a member of the G-protein-coupled-receptor family2 and links succinate signalling to renin-induced hypertension, retinal angiogenesis and inflammation3–5. Because SUCNR1 senses succinate as an immunological danger signal6—which has relevance for diseases including ulcerative colitis, liver fibrosis7, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis3,8—it is of interest as a therapeutic target. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of rat SUCNR1 in complex with an intracellular binding nanobody in the inactive conformation. Structure-based mutagenesis and radioligand-binding studies, in conjunction with molecular modelling, identified key residues for speciesselective antagonist binding and enabled the determination of the high-resolution crystal structure of a humanized rat SUCNR1 in complex with a high-affinity, humanselective antagonist denoted NF-56-EJ40. We anticipate that these structural insights into the architecture of the succinate receptor and its antagonist selectivity will enable structure-based drug discovery and will further help to elucidate the function of SUCNR1 in vitro and in vivo.},

A comparison of the optimum temperature and pH, thermal stability, and CD products synthesized by the variants revealed that the B domain had a major impact on the cyclization activity, thermal stability, and product specificity of the constructed chimera. Complete suppression of the synthesis of CD6 was observed with the variants GeoT-A1/B and GeoT-A1/A2/CDE. The variant GeoT-A1/A2/CDE showed the desired enzyme properties for large-ring CD synthesis. Its melting temperature was 9 °C higher compared to the G825-6 CGTase and it synthesized up to 3.3 gL 1 CD9 to CD12, corresponding to a 1.8- and 2.3-fold increase compared to GeoT and G825-6 CGTase, respectively. In conclusion, GeoT-A1/A2/CDE may be a candidate for the further development of CGTases specifically forming larger CD.},

abstract = {The development of native-like HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimer antigens has enabled the induction of neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses against neutralization-resistant HIV-1 strains in animal models. However, NAb responses are relatively weak and narrow in specificity. Displaying antigens in a multivalent fashion on nanoparticles (NPs) is an established strategy to increase their immunogenicity. Here we present the design and characterization of two-component protein NPs displaying 20 stabilized SOSIP trimers from various HIV-1 strains. The two-component nature permits the incorporation of exclusively well-folded, native-like Env trimers into NPs that self-assemble in vitro with high efficiency. Immunization studies show that the NPs are particularly efficacious as priming immunogens, improve the quality of the Ab response over a conventional one-component nanoparticle system, and are most effective when SOSIP trimers with an apex-proximate neutralizing epitope are displayed. Their ability to enhance and shape the immunogenicity of SOSIP trimers make these NPs a promising immunogen platform.},

abstract = {Label-free differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) is a relatively new method for evaluating the stability of proteins. It can be used as a screening tool for downstream applications such as crystallization. The method is attractive in that it requires miniscule quantities of proteins, it can be performed using intrinsic tryptophan and tyrosine fluorescence, and, with the right equipment, it is easy to perform. To date, the method has been used with proteins in liquid solutions and dispersions. It was of interest to determine if DSF could be used with membrane proteins in the lipid cubic phase (LCP), which increasingly is being used for crystallization in support of structure–function studies. The cubic phase is viscous. Furthermore, in coexistence with excess aqueous solution, as happens during crystallization trials, it can become turbid and scatter light. The concern was that these features may render the mesophase unsuitable for DSF analysis. However, using lysozyme and four integral membrane proteins...},

Detergents are used most often for solubilizing membrane proteins, but they are associated with protein instability and poor compatibility with structural and biophysical studies. Here we present a saposin-lipoprotein nanoparticle system, Salipro, which allows for the reconstitution of membrane proteins in a lipid environment that is stabilized by a scaffold of saposin proteins. We demonstrate the applicability of the method on two purified membrane protein complexes as well as by the direct solubilization and nanoparticle incorporation of a viral membrane protein complex from the virus membrane. Our approach facilitated high-resolution structural studies of the bacterial peptide transporter PeptTSo2 by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and allowed us to stabilize the HIV envelope glycoprotein in a functional state.},

abstract = {During Erwinia chrysanthemi L-asparaginase (ErA) manufacture, minor conformational variants are formed that elute in the acidic region of the analytical ion-exchange HPLC chromatogram. These variants retain enzymatic activity and form part of the biopharmaceutical product, but must be kept within acceptable limits through controlled operation of the manufacturing process. The high isoelectric point of the ErA native tetramer (8.6) leads to certain process steps being operated in the alkaline pH region. Previously, the formation of these species during processing was not fully understood. In this work, in-process samples were analysed, and alkaline pH (8–9) and hold time were found to be the governing parameters. Formation of ErA acidic species was found to be accelerated at higher pH values and longer hold times, suggesting potential control strategies for the manufacturing process. However, the kinetics of ErA conformational variant formation were found to be slow (0.15–0.25 percent per day at pH 8.5). Changes in the ErA melt temperature (Tm) with pH as determined by both differential scanning calorimetry and differential scanning fluorimetry were found to be predictive of the tendency to form the IEX-HPLC acidic species during processing. Biopharmaceutical process developers should be aware of such changes to proteins and build relevant control strategies into process validation plans.},

abstract = {a1-Microglobulin (A1M) is a small glycoprotein that belongs to the lipocalin protein family. A major biological role of A1M is to protect cells and tissues against oxidative damage by clearing free heme and reactive oxygen species. Because of this, the protein has attracted great interest as a potential pharmaceutical candidate for treatment of acute kidney injury and preeclampsia. The aim of this study was to explore the possibility of expressing human A1M in plants through transient gene expression, as an alternative or complement to other expression systems. E. coli, insect and mammalian cell culture have previously been used for recombinant A1M (rA1M) or A1M production, but these systems have various drawbacks, including additional complication and expense in refolding for E. coli, while insect produced rA1M is heavily modified with chromophores and mammalian cell culture has been used only in analytical scale. For that purpose, we have used a viral vector (pJL-TRBO) delivered by Agrobacterium for expression of three modified A1M gene variants in the leaves of N. benthamiana. The results showed that these modified rA1M protein variants, A1M-NB1, A1M-NB2 and A1M-NB3, targeted to the cytosol, ER and extracellular space, respectively, were successfully expressed in the leaves, which was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The cytosol accumulated A1M-NB1 was selected for further analysis, as it appeared to have a higher yield than the other variants, and was purified with a yield of ca. 50 mg/kg leaf. The purified protein had the expected structural and functional properties, displaying heme-binding capacity and capacity of protecting red blood cells against stress-induced cell death. The protein also carried bound chromophores, a characteristic feature of A1M and an indicator of a capacity to bind small molecules. The study showed that expression of the functional protein in N. benthamiana may be an attractive alternative for production of rA1M for pharmaceutical purposes and a basis for future research on A1M structure and function.},

abstract = {The coronavirus disease pandemic of 2019 (COVID- 19) caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus resulted in economic losses and threatened human health worldwide. The pandemic highlights an urgent need for a stable, easily produced, and effective vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 uses the spike protein receptor- binding domain (RBD) to bind its cognate receptor, angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and initiate membrane fusion. Thus, the RBD is an ideal target for vaccine development. In this study, we designed three different RBD-conjugated nanoparticle vaccine candidates, namely, RBD-Ferritin (24-mer), RBD-mi3 (60-mer), and RBD-I53−50 (120-mer), via covalent conjugation using the SpyTag-SpyCatcher system. When mice were immunized with the RBD-conjugated nanoparticles (NPs) in conjunction with the AddaVax or Sigma Adjuvant System, the resulting antisera exhibited 8- to 120-fold greater neutralizing activity against both a pseudovirus and the authentic virus than those of mice immunized with monomeric RBD. Most importantly, sera from mice immunized with RBD-conjugated NPs more efficiently blocked the binding of RBD to ACE2 in vitro, further corroborating the promising immunization effect. Additionally, the vaccine has distinct advantages in terms of a relatively simple scale-up and flexible assembly. These results illustrate that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-conjugated nanoparticles developed in this study are a competitive vaccine candidate and that the carrier nanoparticles could be adopted as a universal platform for a future vaccine development.},
