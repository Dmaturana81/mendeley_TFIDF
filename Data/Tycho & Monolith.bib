abstract = {Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of l-Tryptophan (l-Trp) to yield N-formyl-kynurenine in the first and rate limiting step of the kynurenine pathway. Bioactive metabolites, involved in the regulation of important immunological responses and neurological processes, are then produced by downstream enzymes along the pathway. Inhibitors of IDO1 are being designed and developed as therapeutic agents for immuno-oncology. In this work, we investigated the molecular recognition path of l-Trp to IDO1, integrating biophysical methods with supervised molecular dynamics (suMD) and mutagenesis experiments. Results allowed disclosing for the first time high and low dissociation constants of l-Trp to IDO1, and the presence of a metastable interaction site located at the upper part of a channel whose borders are defined by the EF-loop and the C-terminal part of the JK-loop. Collectively, our results provide new clues for the design of next-generation IDO1 ligands.},

abstract = {Congenital Pouch Colon (CPC) is a rare anorectal anomaly common to northwestern India, specifically Rajasthan. Despite efforts to understand the clinical genetic makeup of CPC, no attempt on identifying non-coding RNAs was done. We have earlier reported CPC's rare variants from whole exome sequencing (WES) across 18 affected samples in a total of 64 subjects. A Smith–Waterman algorithm was used to infer a couple of lncRNAs from WES samples of CPC with predictions from the Noncode database. Further screening and quantification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we ascertained interactions using Micro Scale Thermophoresis (MST). We report the role of lnc-EPB41-1-1 shown to be promiscuously interacting with KIF13A substantiating their role in regulation.},

abstract = {The members of the avidin protein family are well known for their high affinity towards d-biotin and their structural stability. These properties make avidins a valuable tool for various biotechnological applications. In the present study, two avidin-like biotin-binding proteins (named streptavidin C1 and C2) from Streptomyces cinnamonensis were newly identified while exploring antifungal proteins against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum. Streptavidin C1 reveals a low correlation (a sequence identity of approximately 64{\%}) with all known streptavidins, whereas streptavidin C2 shares a sequence identity of approximately 94{\%} with other streptavidins. Here, the crystal structures of streptavidin C1 in the mature form and in complex with biotin at 2.1 and 2.5 {\AA} resolution, respectively, were assessed. The overall structures present similar tetrameric features with D2 symmetry to other (strept)avidin structures. Interestingly, the long C-terminal region comprises a short $\alpha$-helix (C-Lid; residues 169–179) and an extension C-terminal peptide (ECP; residues 180–191) which stretches into the biotin-binding sites of the same monomer. This ECP sequence (–180VTSANPPAS188–) is a newly defined biotin-binding site, which reduces the ability to bind to (strept)avidin family proteins. The novel streptavidin C1 could help in the development of an engineered tetrameric streptavidin with reduced biotin-binding capacity as well as other biomaterial tools.},

abstract = {Microrchidia 3 (MORC3) is a human protein linked to autoimmune disorders, Down syndrome, and cancer. It is a member of a newly identified family of human ATPases with an uncharacterized mechanism of action. Here, we elucidate the molecular basis for inhibition and activation of MORC3. The crystal structure of the MORC3 region encompassing the ATPase and CW domains in complex with a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog demonstrates that the two domains are directly coupled. The extensive ATPase:CW interface stabilizes the protein fold but inhibits the catalytic activity of MORC3. Enzymatic, NMR, mutational, and biochemical analyses show that in the autoinhibited, off staZhang, Y., Klein, B. J., Cox, K. L., Bertulat, B., Tencer, A. H., Holden, M. R., {\ldots} Kutateladze, T. G. (2019). Mechanism for autoinhibition and activation of the MORC3 ATPase. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 13(116), 6111–6119. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1819524116te, the CW domain sterically impedes binding of the ATPase domain to DNA, which in turn is required for the catalytic activity. MORC3 autoinhibition is released by disrupting the intramolecular ATPase:CW coupling through the competitive interaction of CW with histone H3 tail or by mutating the interfacial residues. Binding of CW to H3 leads to a marked rearrangement in the ATPase-CW cassette, which frees the DNA-binding site in active MORC3 (on state). We show that ATP-induced dimerization of the ATPase domain is strictly required for the catalytic activity and that the dimeric form of ATPase-CW might cooperatively bind to dsDNA. Together, our findings uncovered a mechanism underlying the fine-tuned regulation of the catalytic domain of MORC3 by the epigenetic reader, CW.},
