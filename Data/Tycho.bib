abstract = {Methylation of the small ribosome subunit rRNA in the ribosomal decoding center results in exceptionally high-level aminoglycoside resistance in bacteria. Enzymes that methylate 16S rRNA on N7 of nucleotide G1405 (m7G1405) have been identified in both aminoglycoside-producing and clinically drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria. Using a fluorescence polarization 30S-binding assay and a new crystal structure of the methyltransferase RmtC at 3.14 {\AA} resolution, here we report a structure-guided functional study of 30S substrate recognition by the aminoglycoside resistance-associated 16S rRNA (m7G1405) methyltransferases. We found that the binding site for these enzymes in the 30S subunit directly overlaps with that of a second family of aminoglycoside resistance-associated 16S rRNA (m1A1408) methyltransferases, suggesting that both groups of enzymes may exploit the same conserved rRNA tertiary surface for docking to the 30S. Within RmtC, we defined an N-terminal domain surface, comprising basic residues from both the N1 and N2 subdomains, that directly contributes to 30S-binding affinity. In contrast, additional residues lining a contiguous adjacent surface on the C-terminal domain were critical for 16S rRNA modification but did not directly contribute to the binding affinity. The results from our experiments define the critical features of m7G1405 methyltransferase-substrate recognition and distinguish at least two distinct, functionally critical contributions of the tested enzyme residues: 30S-binding affinity and stabilizing a binding-induced 16S rRNA conformation necessary for G1405 modification. Our study sets the scene for future high-resolution structural studies of the 30S-methyltransferase complex and for potential exploitation of unique aspects of substrate recognition in future therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {Cascade reactions are the basis of life in nature and are adapted to research and industry in an increasing manner. The focus of this study is the production of the high-value aromatic ester cinnamyl cinnamate, which can be applied in flavors and fragrances. A three-enzyme cascade was established to realize the synthesis, starting from the corresponding aldehyde with in situ cofactor regeneration in a two-phase system. After characterization of the enzymes, a screening with di erent organic solvents was carried out, whereby xylene was found to be the most suitable solvent for the second phase. The reaction stability of the formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from Candida boidinii is the limiting step during cofactor regeneration. However, the applied enzyme cascade showed an overall yield of 54{\%}. After successful application on lab scale, the limitation by the FDH was overcome by immobilization of the enzymes and an optimized downstream process, transferring the cascade into a miniplant. The upscaling resulted in an increased yield for the esterification, as well as overall yields of 37{\%}.},

abstract = {Noncovalent interactions between biomolecules are critical to their activity. Native mass spectrometry (MS) has enabled characterization of these interactions by preserving noncovalent assemblies for mass analysis, including protein-ligand and protein-protein complexes for a wide range of soluble and membrane proteins. Recent advances in native MS of lipoprotein nanodiscs have also allowed characterization of antimicrobial peptides and membrane proteins embedded in intact lipid bilayers. However, conventional native electrospray ionization (ESI) can disrupt labile interactions. To stabilize macromolecular complexes for native MS, charge reducing reagents can be added to the solution prior to ESI, such as triethylamine, trimethylamine oxide, and imidazole. Lowering the charge acquired during ESI reduces Coulombic repulsion that leads to dissociation, and charge reduction reagents may also lower the internal energy of the ions through evaporative cooling. Here, we tested a range of imidazole derivatives to discover improved charge reducing reagents and to determine how their chemical properties influence charge reduction efficacy. We measured their effects on a soluble protein complex, a membrane protein complex in detergent, and lipoprotein nanodiscs with and without embedded peptides, and used computational chemistry to understand the observed charge-reduction behavior. Together, our data revealed that hydrophobic substituents at the 2 position on imidazole can significantly improve both charge reduction and gas-phase stability over existing reagents. These new imidazole derivatives will be immediately beneficial for a range of native MS applications and provide chemical principles to guide development of novel charge reducing reagents.},

abstract = {The Hippo signaling pathway controls cell–cell contact, cell proliferation, as well as organ size by integrating changes in the cellular microenvironment. In recent years, the pivotal role of Hippo signaling in cancers has been well recognized. Inhibition of the pathway promotes the translocation of the major Hippo pathway effectors, the yes-associated protein (YAP) and its paralog TAZ, to the nucleus, where they interact with the transcription factor family transcriptional enhancer associate domain (TEAD), thus coactivating the expression of downstream genes, leading to cell transformation, tissue overgrowth, and tumor development. Therefore, the interruption of the YAP–TEAD transcriptional complex represents a novel opportunity for the treatment of cancer. Here, we established a fluorescence polarization (FP)-based assay for the identification and evaluation of YAP–TEAD protein–protein interface (PPI) inhibitors at the YAP $\Omega$-loop binding region of TEAD, which is also called interface 3 at the YAP–TEAD binding surface. Furthermore, a patented small molecule (Patent-22) was evaluated by the FP assay, which confirmed that it was a YAP–TEAD PPI inhibitor at interface 3. Possessing great application value, this FP method is reliable, robust, and economical for inhibitor assessment and drug discovery.},

abstract = {SET and MYND domain-containing protein 3 (SMYD3) is a lysine methyltransferase that plays a central role in a variety of cancer diseases, exerting its pro-oncogenic activity by methylation of key proteins, of both nuclear and cytoplasmic nature. However, the role of SMYD3 in the initiation and progression of cancer is not yet fully understood and further biochemical characterization is required to support the discovery of therapeutics targeting this enzyme. We have therefore developed robust protocols for production, handling, and crystallization of SMYD3 and biophysical and biochemical assays for clarification of SMYD3 biochemistry and identification of useful lead compounds. Specifically, a time-resolved biosensor assay was developed for kinetic characterization of SMYD3 interactions. Functional differences in SMYD3 interactions with its natural small molecule ligands SAM and SAH were revealed, with SAM forming a very stable complex. A variety of peptides mimicking putative substrates of SMYD3 were explored in order to expose structural features important for recognition. The interaction between SMYD3 and some peptides was influenced by SAM. A nonradioactive SMYD3 activity assay using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis explored substrate features of importance also for methylation. Methylation was notable only toward MAP kinase kinase kinase 2 (MAP3K2{\_}K260)-mimicking peptides, although binary and tertiary complexes were detected also with other peptides. The analysis supported a random bi-bi mechanistic model for SMYD3 methyltransferase catalysis. Our work unveiled complexities in SMYD3 biochemistry and resulted in procedures suitable for further studies and identification of novel starting points for design of effective and specific leads for this potential oncology target.},

abstract = {One of the central challenges in the development of single-molecule protein sequencing technologies is achieving high-fidelity sequential recognition and detection of specific amino acids that comprise the peptide sequence. An approach towards achieving this goal is to leverage naturally occurring proteins that function through recognition of amino (N)-terminal amino acids (NAAs). One such protein, the N-end rule pathway adaptor protein ClpS, natively recognizes NAAs on a peptide chain. The native ClpS protein has a high specificity albeit modest affinity for the amino acid Phe at the N-terminus but also recognizes the residues Trp, Tyr, and Leu at the N-terminal position. Here, we employed directed evolution methods to select for ClpS variants with enhanced affinity and selectivity for two NAAs (Phe and Trp). Using this approach, we identified two promising variants of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens ClpS protein with native residues 34–36 ProArgGlu mutated to ProMetSer and CysProSer. In vitro surface binding assays indicate that the ProMetSer variant has enhanced affinity for Phe at the N-terminus with sevenfold tighter binding relative to wild-type ClpS, and that the CysProSer variant binds selectively to Trp over Phe at the N-terminus while having a greater affinity for both Trp and Phe. Taken together, this work demonstrates the utility of engineering ClpS to make it more effective for potential use in peptide sequencing applications.},

Here, we identify how the Na+/H+-exchanger 1 (NHE1), a key regulator of cellular pH homeostasis, is regulated by the Ser/Thr phosphatase calcineurin (CN). NHE1 activity is increased by phosphorylation of NHE1 residue T779, which is specifically dephosphorylated by CN. While it is known that Ser/Thr protein phosphatases prefer pThr over pSer, we show that this preference is not key to this exquisite CN selectivity. Rather a combination of molecular mechanisms, including recognition motifs, dynamic charge-charge interactions and a substrate interaction pocket lead to selective dephosphorylation of pT779. Our data identify T779 as a site regulating NHE1-mediated cellular acid extrusion and provides a molecular understanding of NHE1 substrate selection by CN, specifically, and how phosphatases recruit specific substrates, generally.},

Responsible for the long half-life is FcRn that protects albumin from intracellular degradation. An in-depth understanding of how FcRn binds albumin across species is of importance for design and evaluation of albumin-based therapeutics. Albumin consists of three homologous domains where domain I and domain III of human albumin are crucial for binding to human FcRn. Here, we show that swapping of two loops in domain I or the whole domain with the corresponding sequence in mouse albumin results in reduced binding to human FcRn. In contrast, humanizing domain I of mouse albumin improves binding. We reveal that domain I of mouse albumin plays a minor role in the interaction with the mouse and human receptors, as domain III on its own binds with similar affinity as full-length mouse albumin. Further, we show that P573 in domain III of mouse albumin is required for strong receptor binding. Our study highlights distinct differences in structural requirements for the interactions between mouse and human albumin with their respective receptor, which should be taken into consideration in design of albumin-based drugs and evaluation in mouse models.},

TaLPMO9A was found to retain most of its initial activity after incubating at 100 °C while its apparent melting temperature (Tm) is 69 °C at neutral pH. Interestingly, our studies show that holoTaLPMO9A, apoTaLPMO9A and deglycosylated TaLPMO9A can fold back to their original conformation upon lowering the temperature.

For a better understanding of the observations molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to quantify ADH's molecular flexibility, hydration layer, and intra‐protein hydrogen bonds. The behavior of the enzyme in DES follows the classic dependence of water activity (aW) in non‐conventional media. At low aW values ({\textless} 0.2) ADH does not show any activity, at higher aW values the activity was still lower than in pure water due to the high viscosities of the DES. These findings could be further explained by an increased enzyme flexibility with increased water content.},

SDS22 has numerous diverse functions, surprisingly acting as both a PP1 inhibitor and as an activator. Here, we integrate cellular, biophysical, and crystallographic studies to address this conundrum. We discovered that SDS22 selectively binds a unique conformation of PP1 that contains a single metal (M2) at its active site, i.e., SDS22 traps metal-deficient inactive PP1. Furthermore, we showed that SDS22 dissociation is accompanied by a second metal (M1) being loaded into PP1, as free metal cannot dissociate the complex and M1-deficient mutants remain constitutively trapped by SDS22. Together, our findings reveal that M1 metal loading and loss are essential for PP1 regulation in cells, which has broad implications for PP1 maturation, activity, and holoenzyme subunit exchange.},
