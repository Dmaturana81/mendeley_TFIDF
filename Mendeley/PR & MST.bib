abstract = {Saposin-derived lipid nanoparticles (SapNPs) are a new alternative tool for membrane protein reconstitution. Here we demonstrate the potential and advantages of SapNPs. We show that SapA has the lowest lipid specificity for SapNP formation. These nanoparticles are modular and offer a tunable range of size and composition depending on the stoichiometric ratio of lipid and saposin components. They are stable and exhibit features typical of lipid-bilayer systems. Our data suggest that SapNPs are versatile and can adapt to membrane proteins of various sizes and architectures. Using SapA and various types of lipids we could reconstitute membrane proteins of different transmembrane cross-sectional areas (from 14 to 56 transmembrane $\alpha$ helices). SapNP-reconstituted proteins bound their respective ligands and were more heat stable compared with the detergent-solubilized form. Moreover, SapNPs encircle membrane proteins in a compact way, allowing structural investigations of small membrane proteins in a detergent-free environment using small-angle X-ray scattering. Saposin-derived lipid nanoparticles (SapNPs) are an alternative tool for membrane protein (MP) reconstitution. Flayhan et al. characterize these nanoparticles, showing that they are versatile and can adapt to MPs of various sizes and architectures. SapNP-reconstituted MPs can be treated as soluble proteins and used for structural and functional studies.},

abstract = {The present study reports a method for transporting high molecular weight collagen for skin regeneration. An independent engineered enzymatic vehicle that has the ability for efficient transdermal delivery of regenerative biomaterial was developed for tissue regeneration. Collagen has been well recognized as a skin regeneration molecule due to its interaction with the extracellular matrix to stimulate skin cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. However, the transdermal delivery of collagen poses a significant challenge due to its high molecular weight as well as a lack of efficient approaches. Here, to improve the transdermal delivery efficiency, $\alpha$-1,4-glycosidic hydrolase was engineered with genetically encoded 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine, which enhanced its biological activity as revealed by microscale thermophoresis. The remodeled catalytic pocket resulted in enhanced substrate binding activity of the enzyme with a predominant glycosaminoglycan (chondroitin sulfate) present in the extracellular matrix of the skin. The engineered enzyme rapidly opened up the skin extracellular matrix fiber (15 min) to ferry collagen across the wall, without disturbing the cellular bundle architecture. Confocal microscopy indicated that macromolecules had diffused three times deeper into the engineered enzyme-treated skin than the native enzyme-treated skin. Gene expression, histopathology, and hematology analysis also supported the penetration of macromolecules. Cytotoxicity (mammalian cell culture) and in vivo (Caenorhabditis elegans and Rattus noryegicus) studies revealed that the congener enzyme could potentially be used as a penetration enhancer, which is of paramount importance for the multimillion cosmetic industries. Hence, it offers promise as a pharmaceutical enzyme for transdermal delivery bioenhancement and dermatological applications.},

abstract = {2',3'-cAMP is an intriguing small molecule that is conserved among different kingdoms. 2',3'-cAMP is presumably produced during RNA degradation, with increased cellular levels observed especially under stress conditions. Previously, we observed the presence of 2',3'-cAMP in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) protein complexes isolated from native lysate, suggesting that 2',3'-cAMP has potential protein partners in plants. Here, affinity purification experiments revealed that 2',3'-cAMP associates with the stress granule (SG) proteome. SGs are aggregates composed of protein and mRNA, which enable cells to selectively store mRNA for use in response to stress such as heat whereby translation initiation is impaired. Using size-exclusion chromatography and affinity purification analyses, we identified Rbp47b, the key component of SGs, as a potential interacting partner of 2',3'-cAMP. Furthermore, SG formation was promoted in 2',3'-cAMP-treated Arabidopsis seedlings, and interactions between 2',3'-cAMP and RNA-binding domains of Rbp47b, RRM2 and RRM3, were confirmed in vitro using microscale thermophoresis. Taken together, these results (1) describe novel small-molecule regulation of SG formation, (2) provide evidence for the biological role of 2',3'-cAMP, and (3) demonstrate an original biochemical pipeline for the identification of protein-metabolite interactors.},

Comparative studies into TALE repeat structure and function are hindered by the limited sequence variation among TALE repeats. More sequence-diverse TALE-like proteins are known from Ralstonia solanacearum (RipTALs) and Burkholderia rhizoxinica (Bats), but RipTAL and Bat repeats are conserved with those of TALEs around the DNA-binding residue. We study two novel marine-organism TALE-like proteins (MOrTL1 and MOrTL2), the first to date of non-terrestrial origin. We have assessed their DNA-binding properties and modelled repeat structures. We found that repeats from these proteins mediate sequence specific DNA binding conforming to the TALE code, despite low sequence similarity to TALE repeats, and with novel residues around the BSR. However, MOrTL1 repeats show greater sequence discriminating power than MOrTL2 repeats. Sequence alignments show that there are only three residues conserved between repeats of all TALE-like proteins including the two new additions. This conserved motif could prove useful as an identifier for future TALE-likes. Additionally, comparing MOrTL repeats with those of other TALE-likes suggests a common evolutionary origin for the TALEs, RipTALs and Bats.},

Here, we report a single point mutation in the gene encoding Elongator complex subunit 6 causing Purkinje neuron degeneration and an ataxia-like phenotype in the mutant wobbly mouse. This mutation destabilizes the complex and compromises its function in translation regulation, leading to protein misfolding, proteotoxic stress, and eventual neuronal death. In addition, we show that substantial microgliosis is triggered by the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in the cerebellum and that blocking NLRP3 function in vivo significantly delays neuronal degeneration and the onset of ataxia in mutant animals. Our data provide a mechanistic insight into the pathophysiology of a cerebellar ataxia caused by an Elongator mutation, substantiating the increasing body of evidence that alterations of this complex are broadly implicated in the onset of a number of diverse neurological disorders.},

abstract = {The interaction between TNF-$\alpha$ with TNFR1 triggers important signaling pathways inducing diverse cellular phenomena including inflammation, apoptosis, etc., and is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of numerous autoimmune diseases. The extracellular domain (ECD) of TNFR has been successfully used to clinically treat such TNF-associated diseases. However, large-scale production of these biological material via eukaryotic cell expression systems is usually costly owing to the culture medium and complicated growth conditions. This study aimed to extract pure soluble human TNFR1-ECD and investigate its biological activity, using a prokaryotic expression system. Recombinant vector pMCSG7-TNFR1-ECD was constructed via ligation-independent cloning. The His-tag fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and localized in inclusion bodies. Recombinant TNFR1-ECD was refolded and purified via nickel-affinity chromatography, tag cleavage, followed by cation-exchange chromatography or size-exclusion chromatography. A purity of over 95{\%} and a yield of 9.3 mg protein per liter of bacterial culture media was obtained. The purified protein showed significant affinity of 2.15 nM towards human TNF-$\alpha$ and inhibited TNF-$\alpha$-mediated cytotoxicity in L929 cells, with an ED50 of 0.10 $\mu$g/ml. It formed a self-associated oligomer with a KD of 1.15 $\mu$M, detected via microscale thermophoresis. We thus established a highly efficient approach to construct, express, and purify the recombinant protein of human TNFR1-ECD from a prokaryotic system. The antagonistic bioactivities in vitro indicate this protein as a prospective molecules for drug research against autoimmune diseases characterized by TNF-$\alpha$ overexpression.},

abstract = {Visceral adipose tissue derived serine protease inhibitor (vaspin) is a member of the serpin family and has been shown to have beneficial effects on glucose tolerance, insulin stability as well as adipose tissue inflammation, parameters seriously affected by obesity. Some of these effects require inhibition of target proteases such as kallikrein 7(KLK7) and many studies have demonstrated vaspin-mediated activation of intracellular signaling cascades in various cells and tissues. So far, little is known about the exact mechanism how vaspin may trigger these intracellular signaling events. In this study, we investigated and characterized the interaction of vaspin with membrane lipids and polyphosphates as well as their potential regulatory effects on serpin activity using recombinant vaspin and KLK7 proteins and functional protein variants thereof. Here, we show for the first time that vaspin binds to phospholipids and polyphosphates with varying effects on KLK7 inhibition. Vaspin binds strongly to monophosphorylated phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PtdInsP) with no effect on vaspin activation. Microscale thermophoresis (MST) measurements revealed high-affinity binding to polyphosphate 45 (KD: 466 ± 75 nM) and activation of vaspin in a heparin-like manner. Furthermore, we identified additional residues in the heparin binding site in $\beta$-sheet A by mutating five basic residues resulting in complete loss of high-affinity heparin binding. Finally, using lipid overlay assays, we show that these residues are additionally involved in PtdInsP binding. Phospholipids play a major role in membrane trafficking and signaling whereas polyphosphates are procoagulant and proinflammatory agents. The identification of phospholipids and polyphosphates as binding partners of vaspin will contribute to the understanding of vaspins involvement in membrane trafficking, signaling and beneficial effects associated with obesity.},

abstract = {Small molecules not only represent cellular building blocks and metabolic intermediates, but also regulatory ligands and signaling molecules that interact with proteins. Although these interactions affect cellular metabolism, growth, and development, they have been largely understudied. Herein, we describe a method, which we named PROtein–Metabolite Interactions using Size separation (PROMIS), that allows simultaneous, global analysis of endogenous protein–small molecule and of protein–protein complexes. To this end, a cell-free native lysate from Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography, followed by quantitative metabolomic and proteomic analyses. Proteins and small molecules showing similar elution behavior, across protein-containing fractions, constituted putative interactors. Applying PROMIS to an A. thaliana extract, we ascertained known protein– protein (PPIs) and protein–metabolite (PMIs) interactions and reproduced binding between small-molecule protease inhibitors and their respective proteases. More importantly, we present examples of two experimental strategies that exploit the PROMIS dataset to identify novel PMIs. By looking for similar elution behavior of metabolites and enzymes belonging to the same biochemical pathways, we identified putative feedback and feed-forward regulations in pantothenate biosynthesis and the methionine salvage cycle, respectively. By combining PROMIS with an orthogonal affinity purification approach, we identified an interaction between the dipeptide Tyr–Asp and the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. In summary, we present proof of concept for a powerful experimental tool that enables system-wide analysis of PMIs and PPIs across all biological systems. The dataset obtained here comprises nearly 140 metabolites and 5000 proteins, which can be mined for putative interactors.},

It was of interest to determine if DSF could be used with membrane proteins in the lipid cubic phase (LCP), which increasingly is being used for crystallization in support of structure–function studies.

In contrast, a homologue from Escherichia coli, DtpA (dipeptide and tripeptide permease), shows a high similarity to human PepT1 (SLC15A1) in terms of ligand selectivity and transports a similar set of drugs. Here, we present the crystal structure of DtpA in ligand-free form (at 3.30 {\AA} resolution) and in complex with the antiviral prodrug valganciclovir (at 2.65 {\AA} resolution) supported by biochemical data. We show that valganciclovir unexpectedly binds with the ganciclovir moiety mimicking the N-terminal residue of a canonical peptide substrate. On the basis of a homology model we argue that this binding mode also applies to the human PepT1 transporter. Our results provide new insights into the binding mode of prodrugs and will assist the rational design of drugs with improved absorption rates. ■},

The human isoform CHP3 is important for transport of NHE1 to the plasma membrane and for its activity. Here, we characterized the binding interaction of human CHP3 with the regulatory domain of NHE1. The exact binding site of CHP3 was previously debated. CHP3 as well as both regions of NHE1 in question were produced and purified. CHP3 specifically formed stable complexes with the CHP-binding region (CBD) of NHE1 (residues 503–545) in size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), but not with the C-terminal region (CTD, residues 633–815). CTD was functional as shown by Ca2+-dependent binding of calmodulin in SEC analysis. CHP3 bound with high affinity to CBD with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 56 nM determined by microscale thermophoresis. The high affinity was substantiated by isothermal calorimetry analysis (KD = 3 nM), which also revealed that the interaction with CBD is strongly exothermic ($\Delta$G° = −48.6 kJ/mol, $\Delta$H = −75.3 kJ/mol, −T$\Delta$S° = 26.7 kJ/mol).

abstract = {Glucose homeostasis and growth essentially depend on the peptide hormone insulin engaging its receptor. Despite biochemical and structural advances, a fundamental contradiction has persisted in the current understanding of insulin ligand–receptor interactions. While biochemistry predicts two distinct insulin binding sites, 1 and 2, recent structural analyses have only resolved site 1. Using a combined approach of cryo-EM and atomistic molecular dynamics simulation, we determined the structure of the entire dimeric insulin receptor ectodomain saturated with four insulin molecules. Complementing the previously described insulin–site 1 interaction, we present the first view of insulin bound to the discrete insulin receptor site 2. Insulin binding stabilizes the receptor ectodomain in a T-shaped conformation wherein the membrane-proximal domains converge and contact each other. These findings expand the current models of insulin binding to its receptor and of its regulation. In summary, we provide the structural basis enabling a comprehensive description of ligand–receptor interactions that ultimately will inform new approaches to structure-based drug design. In brief A cryo-EM structure of the complete insulin receptor ectodomain saturated with four insulin ligands is reported. The structural model of the insulin–insulin receptor complex adopts a T-shaped conformation, reveals two additional insulin-binding sites potentially involved in the initial interaction of insulin with its receptor, and resolves the membrane proximal region.},

abstract = {Reducing the aggregation of proteins is of utmost interest to the pharmaceutical industry. Aggregated proteins are often less active and can cause severe immune reactions in the patient upon administration. At the same time the biopharmaceutical market is pushing for high concentration formulations and products that do not require refrigerated storage conditions. For a given protein, the only solution pH, ionic strength and concentration of a very limited number of excipients are the only parameters that can be varied to obtain a stable formulation. In this work, we present a structure-based approach to discover new molecules that successfully reduce the aggregation of proteins and apply the approach to the model protein Interferon-alpha-2a.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 outbreak spread in China and is a threat to the world. The aims of this study to help health workers better understand the epidemic of the COVID-19 and provide different control strategies toward Hubei Province and other regions in China. A comprehensive search of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention official websites and announcements was performed between 20 Jan 2019 and 29 Feb 2020. The relevant data of the distribution of the infection on each reported day were obtained.Up to 29 Feb 2020, 79,824 confirmed cases with the COVID-19 including 66,907 in Hubei Province and 12,377 in other administrative regions were reported.The SARS-COV-2 showed faster epidemic trends compared with the 2003-SARS-CoV. A total of 2,870 deaths have been reported with a mortality of 3.6{\%}. The mortality of the COVID-19 was nationwide among 79,824 confirmed cases, significantly higher in Hubei Province than that in other regions(4.1{\%} versus 0.84{\%}). Since 1 Feb 2020 the number of discharged cases exceeded the number of the dead. By 29 Feb 2020, the number of discharged patients was 41,625, which exceeded the number of hospitalized patients, and the trend has further increased. The infection of the SARS-COV-2 is spreading and increasing nationwide, and Hubei Province is the main epidemic area, with higher mortality. The outbreak is now under initial control especially in other regions outside of Hubei Province. Due to the different epidemic characteristics between Hubei Province and other regions, we should focus on different prevention and control strategies.},
