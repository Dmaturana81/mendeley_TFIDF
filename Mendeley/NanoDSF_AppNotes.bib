abstract = {The development of therapeutic antibodies requires optimal formulations for long-term antibody stability. For this, buffer screening approaches are routinely used, in which the thermal stability of a given antibody in different buffers are tested. The buffers typically vary regarding buffer substances, pH values, salt concentrations and other excipients. The prerequisite for such screening approaches are high measurement precision, low sample consumption, and high throughput. Moreover, it is highly desirable to measure under native conditions, without dilution of the antibody or the requirement to use reporter dyes or other modifications. Here we present nanoDSF, a label-free, native DSF technique, as the method of choice to perform rapid and precise buffer screening projects for therapeutic antibodies during the drug development process.},

abstract = {The assessment of thermal stability parameters of biologics is an integral part of formulation development in biopharmaceutical research. The ever growing number of biologics in the development pipelines worldwide demands rapid and precise methods to quickly screen large sets of conditions in an easy and straight- forward manner. In our study, we compare two methods for the detection of thermal unfolding transition temperatures (Tm) of a therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb): nanoDSF, which analyzes changes in the fluorescence emission properties of proteins, and differential scanning calorimetry (µDSC), which detects changes in the heat capacity of a protein solution upon unfolding. nanoDSF and µDSC both provide precise and consistent data. nanoDSF in addition overcomes several limitations by µDSC, such as low throughput and high sample consumption, and thus represents the ideal technology for rapid and precise thermal stability screening in biopharmaceutical development.},

abstract = {A thermal unfolding based assay using low volume differential intrinsic tryptophan scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) was applied to study the stabilizing effects of ligands on G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are the fourth largest superfamily in the human genome and are the largest class of targets for drug discovery. The system has been validated using human adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR). A2AR binds natural (adenosine and caffeine) and synthetic ligands with different affinities to mediate a variety of physiological and pharmacological responses. Several well- characterized ligands were used for the unfolding experiments. The $\Delta$Tm shift values obtained from nanoDSF analysis and traditional ligand binding studies correlate well with each other. We further characterized a second human GPCR target (test-GPCR) for which traditional cysteine-reactive DSF has been problematic. nanoDSF demonstrated that small molecule ligands can stabilize the detergent-solubilized receptor, thus showing the target GPCR is active in a selected detergent and lipid-free environment. In addition, we report a buffer composition screen to further stabilize the receptor in its detergent environment for biophysical assays. Based on our results, we show that the nanoDSF technology will allow the development of an automated screening platform in a label-free environment to evaluate a large number of compounds for lead discovery and to improve receptor stability for biophysical assays by screening buffer conditions.},

The results were in excellent agreement with conventional screening methods, while dramatically reducing sample consumption and measurement times.

abstract = {One of the most important parameters in the development of therapeutic biologics is their long-term stability. While after purification being seemingly stable in a variety of formulations, many antibodies display very slow aggregation kinetics over time. This gradual aggregation could thus far only be evaluated by monitoring monomer contents and aggregates over months or even years. Predictive methods are therefore urgently needed to speed up the development of biologics. Here we demonstrate that the Prometheus NT.Plex by NanoTemper Technologies can be used for predicting long-term stability in only a few hours. The approach uses a combination of thermal and chemical unfolding analysis in a high-throughput setting. We show that chemical denaturation is a tool which can determine folding enthalpies of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to predict their long-term stability in formulation screenings. Using the Prometheus NT.Plex nanoDSF instrument with aggregation detection optics, we screened 5 formulations at different mAb concentrations for their thermal and chemical stability. The obtained unfolding data correlates with long-term turbidity and monomer content over time, showing that the Prometheus NT.Plex can be used to rapidly predict the long-term stability of biologics within 1 day.},
