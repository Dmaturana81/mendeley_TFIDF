abstract = {The importin $\alpha$ family belongs to the conserved nuclear transport pathway in eukaryotes. However, the biological functions of importin $\alpha$ in the plasma membrane are still elusive. Here, we report that importin $\alpha$, as a plasma membrane-associated protein, is exploited by the rice stripe virus (RSV) to enter vector insect cells, especially salivary gland cells. When the expression of three importin $\alpha$ genes was simultaneously knocked down, few vi-rions entered the salivary glands of the small brown planthopper, Laodelphax striatellus. Through hemocoel inoculation of virions, only importin $\alpha$2 was found to efficiently regulate viral entry into insect salivary-gland cells. Importin $\alpha$2 bound the nucleocapsid protein of RSV with a relatively high affinity through its importin $\beta$-binding (IBB) domain, with a dissociation constant K D of 9.1 $\mu$M. Furthermore, importin $\alpha$2 and its IBB domain showed a distinct distribution in the plasma membrane through binding to heparin in heparan sulfate proteoglycan. When the expression of importin $\alpha$2 was knocked down in viruliferous planthoppers or in nonviru-liferous planthoppers before they acquired virions, the viral transmission efficiency of the vector insects in terms of the viral amount and disease incidence in rice was dramatically decreased. These findings not only reveal the specific function of the importin $\alpha$ family in the plasma membrane utilized by viruses, but also provide a promising target gene in vector insects for manipulation to efficiently control outbreaks of rice stripe disease. importin $\alpha$ | plasma membrane | small brown planthopper | salivary gland | rice stripe virus T he importin $\alpha$ family belongs to the conserved importin $\alpha$/$\beta$ nuclear transport pathway in eukaryotes (1-3). It is well known that the importin $\alpha$ family plays an indispensable role in transporting proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, with diverse functions in gene regulation, cell physiology, and differentiation (1, 4, 5). In addition to nucleocytoplasmic transport, some members of the importin $\alpha$ family localize to the plasma membrane with pal-mitoylation modification or through binding to heparin in heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) (6-8). Increased importin $\alpha$ levels in the plasma membrane are concomitant with decreased importin $\alpha$ levels in the cytoplasm, which affect the nuclear import of cargos and regulates intracellular scaling (7). However, the function of the importin $\alpha$ family in the plasma membrane is still elusive. Many plant viruses are transmitted by vector insects in a persistent , circulative mode, which is characterized by systemic invasion of diverse tissues prior to entering salivary glands and release in saliva (9-13). The salivary glands are the last barriers for viral transmission to overcome (14-18). Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms underlying viral entry into salivary-gland cells are not well known. The rice stripe virus (RSV) is a typical persistent, circulative plant virus and is capable of proliferating in the midgut epithelial cells and of being efficiently transmitted by the vector insect small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus) (19). This virus causes one of the most destructive rice stripe diseases, showing an incidence of up to 80% and causing yield losses of 30 to 40% in the rice fields of Asian countries (20). RSV is a non-enveloped negative-strand RNA virus of the Tenuivirus genus (21, 22). The genome of RSV contains four single-stranded RNA segments, each of which is encapsidated by a viral nucleocapsid protein (NP). In addition to the NP, RSV encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and five nonstructural proteins (NS2, NSvc2, NS3, SP, and NSvc4) (23-25). In our recent work, we found that three importin $\alpha$ proteins, importin $\alpha$1 (GenBank registration number MT036051), $\alpha$2 (MT036050), and $\alpha$3 (MT036052), of the small brown planthopper participate in the nuclear entry of RSV through direct interactions with RSV NPs, triggering an antiviral caspase-dependent apoptotic reaction (26). Knockdown of the expression of all the three importin $\alpha$ genes retarded the nuclear entry of RSV and led to an increase in viral load in planthoppers (26). However, we did not determine the influence on viral transmission. In the present study, we surprisingly found that one of the importin $\alpha$ proteins, importin $\alpha$2, is associated with the plasma membrane and efficiently facilitates viral entry into insect salivary glands and subsequent viral transmission. Results Effect of the Importin $\alpha$ Family on RSV Transmission by Planthoppers. To test the effects of the three importin $\alpha$ proteins on RSV transmission, we knocked down all three importin $\alpha$ genes in viru-liferous third-instar planthoppers by injecting a mixture of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) for the three importin $\alpha$ genes (ds3IMP-RNA) (Fig. 1A and SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). As expected from previous work (26), the RSV amount in terms of the NP RNA level and viral genomic levels significantly increased in the whole bodies of viruliferous planthoppers at 8 d after ds3IMP-RNA delivery, Significance The importin $\alpha$ family is well known as a cargo transporter from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, with diverse functions in eukaryotes. However, some members of the importin $\alpha$ family also localize to the cell membrane. Here, we report that a cell membrane-associated importin $\alpha$ takes part in viral transmission by vector insects. Importin $\alpha$2 of the small brown planthopper binds the rice stripe virus on the proteoglycans of the cell membrane and efficiently controls viral entry into insect salivary glands and subsequent transmission to rice. These findings not only demonstrate the specific function of importin $\alpha$ in the cell membrane utilized by viruses, but also provide a promising target gene for preventing outbreaks of rice stripe disease.},

abstract = {Background: Human HINT2 is an important mitochondrial enzyme involved in many processes such as apoptosis and bioenergetics, but its endogenous substrates and the three-dimensional structure of the full-length protein have not been identified yet. Methods: An HPLC assay was used to test the hydrolytic activity of HINT2 against various adenosine, guanosine, and 2′-deoxyguanosine derivatives containing phosphate bonds of different types and different leaving groups. Data on binding affinity were obtained by microscale thermophoresis (MST). Crystal structures of HINT2, in its apo form and with a dGMP ligand, were resolved to atomic resolution. Results: HINT2 substrate specificity was similar to that of HINT1, but with the major exception of remarkable discrimination against substrates lacking the 2′-hydroxyl group. The biochemical results were consistent with binding affinity measurements. They showed a similar binding strength of AMP and GMP to HINT2, and much weaker binding of dGMP, in contrast to HINT1. A non-hydrolyzable analog of Ap4A (JB419) interacted with both proteins with similar Kd and Ap4A is the signaling molecule that can interact with hHINT1 and regulate the activity of some transcription factors. Conclusions: Several forms of homo- and heterodimers of different lengths of N-terminally truncated polypeptides resulting from degradation of the full-length protein were described. Ser144 in HINT2 appeared to be functionally equivalent to Ser107 in HINT1 by supporting the protonation of the leaving group in the hydrolytic mechanism of HINT2. Significance: Our results should be considered in future studies on the natural function of HINT2 and its role in nucleotide prodrug processing.},

abstract = {Site-specific antibody conjugations generate homogeneous antibody-drug conjugates with high therapeutic index. However, there are limited examples for producing the site-specific conjugates with a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) greater than two, especially using engineered cysteines. Based on available Fc structures, we designed and introduced free cysteine residues into various antibody CH2 and CH3 regions to explore and expand this technology. The mutants were generated using site-directed mutagenesis with good yield and properties. Conjugation efficiency and selectivity were screened using PEGylation. The top single cysteine mutants were then selected and combined as double cysteine mutants for expression and further investigation. Thirty-six out of thirtyeight double cysteine mutants display comparable expression with low aggregation similar to the wild-type antibody. PEGylation screening identified seventeen double cysteine mutants with good conjugatability and high selectivity. PEGylation was demonstrated to be a valuable and efficient approach for quickly screening mutants for high selectivity as well as conjugation efficiency. Our work demonstrated the feasibility of generating antibody conjugates with a DAR greater than 3.4 and high site-selectivity using THIOMAB™ method. The top single or double cysteine mutants identified can potentially be applied to site-specific antibody conjugation of cytotoxin or other therapeutic agents as a next generation conjugation strategy.},

abstract = {TrkB is a tyrosine kinase receptor that is activated upon binding to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). To date, the search for low-molecular-weight molecules mimicking BDNF's action has been unsuccessful. Several molecules exerting antidepressive effects in vivo, such as 7, 8-DHF, have been suggested to be TrkB agonists. However, more recent publications question this hypothesis. In this study, we developed a set of experimental procedures including the evaluation of direct interactions, dimerization, downstream signaling, and cytoprotection in parallel with physicochemical and ADME methods to verify the pharmacology of 7, 8-DHF and other potential reference compounds, and perform screening for novel TrkB agonists. 7, 8 DHF bound to TrkB with Kd = 1.3 µM; however, we were not able to observe any other activity against the TrkB receptor in SN56 T48 and differentiated SH-SY5Y cell lines. Moreover, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of 7, 8-DHF at doses of 1 and 50 mg/kg were examined in mice after i.v and oral administration, respectively. The poor pharmacokinetic properties and lack of observed activation of TrkB-dependent signaling in the brain confirmed that 7, 8-DHF is not a relevant tool for studying TrkB activation in vivo. The binding profile for 133 molecular targets revealed a significant lack of selectivity of 7, 8-DHF, suggesting a distinct functional profile independent of interaction with TrkB. Additionally, a compound library was screened in search of novel lowmolecular- weight orthosteric TrkB agonists; however, we were not able to identify reliable drug candidates. Our results suggest that published reference compounds including 7, 8-DHF do not activate TrkB, consistent with canonical dogma, which indicates that the reported pharmacological activity of these compounds should be interpreted carefully in a broad functional context.},

abstract = {The MYCN gene encodes the transcription factor N-Myc, a driver of neuroblastoma (NB). Targeting G-quadruplexes (G4s) with small molecules is attractive strategy to control the expression of undruggable proteins such as N-Myc. However, selective binders to G4s are challenging to identify due to the structural similarity of many G4s. Here, we report the discovery of a small molecule ligand (4) that targets the noncanonical, hairpin containing G4 structure found in the MYCN gene using small molecule microarrays (SMMs). Unlike many G4 binders, the compound was found to bind to a pocket at the base of the hairpin region of the MYCN G4. This compound stabilizes the G4 and has affinity of 3.5 ± 1.6 $\mu$M. Moreover, an improved analog, MY-8, suppressed levels of both MYCN and MYCNOS (a lncRNA embedded within the MYCN gene) in NBEB neuroblastoma cells. This work indicates that the approach of targeting complex, hybrid G4 structures that exist throughout the human genome may be an applicable strategy to achieve selectivity for targeting disease-relevant genes including protein coding (MYCN) as well as non-coding (MYCNOS) gene products.},

abstract = {Objective: The ability to form nucleoprotein complexes is a fundamental activity of DNA replication initiation proteins. They bind within or nearby the region of replication origin what results in melting of a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and formation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) region where the replication machinery can assemble. For prokaryotic initiators it was shown that they interact with the formed ssDNA and that this interaction is required for the replication activity. The ability to interact with ssDNA was also shown for Saccharomyces cerevisiae replication initiation protein complex ORC. For Archaea, which combine features of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, there was no evidence whether DNA replication initiators can interact with ssDNA. We address this issue in this study. Results: Using purified Orc1 protein from Aeropyrum pernix (ApOrc1) we analyzed its ability to interact with ssDNA containing sequence of an AT-rich region of the A. pernix origin Ori1 as well as with homopolymers of thymidine (polyT) and adenosine (polyA). The Bio-layer interferometry, surface plasmon resonance and microscale thermophoresis showed that the ApOrc1 can interact with ssDNA and it binds preferentially to T-rich ssDNA. The hydrolysis of ATP is not required for this interaction.},

Mucoadhesivity of both thermo-gelled and covalently cross-linked polymeric systems, as well as their ability to interact with dexamethasone, was assessed by microscale thermophoresis (MST). Mucoadhesion properties were also evaluated by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), which were in good correlation with MST data. The presence of disulfide linkages and thiol groups were shown to favor improved binding of cross-linked nanogels to mucin.

To this aim, C$\alpha$-tetrasubstituted amino acid Aib was introduced into the N-terminal tail, peptide loop, or C-terminal helix. NMR studies confirmed the stabilization of the helical conformation in proximity to the Aib residue. We found that the induction of the N-terminal helical structure or stabilization of the C-terminal helix can noticeably increase the peptide affinity to the VEGF. These peptides efficiently inhibited VEGF-stimulated cell proliferation as well. The insertion of the non-proteinogenic Aib residue significantly enhanced the stability of the peptides in the vitreous environment. Thus, these Aib-containing peptides are promising candidates for the design of VEGF inhibitors with improved properties.},

abstract = {Pathogen surface antigens are at the forefront of the viral strategy when invading host organisms. These antigens, including membrane proteins (MPs), are broadly targeted by the host immune response. Obtaining these MPs in a soluble and stable form constitutes a real challenge, regardless of the application purposes (e.g. quantification/characterization assays, diagnosis, and preventive and curative strategies). A rapid process to obtain a native-like antigen by solubilization of a full-length MP directly from a pathogen is reported herein. Rabies virus (RABV) was used as a model for this demonstration and its full-length G glycoprotein (RABV-G) was stabilized with amphipathic polymers, named amphipols (APols). The stability of RABV-G trapped in APol A8-35 (RABV-G/A8-35) was evaluated under different stress conditions (temperature, agitation, and light exposure). RABV-G/A8-35 in liquid form exhibited higher unfolding temperature (+6°C) than in detergent and was demonstrated to be antigenically stable over 1 month at 5°C and 25°C. Kinetic modeling of antigenicity data predicted antigenic stability of RABV-G/A8-35 in a solution of up to 1 year at 5°C. The RABV-G/A8-35 complex formulated in an optimized buffer composition and subsequently freeze-dried displayed long-term stability for 2-years at 5, 25, and 37°C. This study reports for the first time that a natural full-length MP extracted from a virus, complexed to APols and subsequently freeze-dried, displayed long-term antigenic stability, without requiring storage under refrigerated conditions.},

abstract = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Its genome encodes two open reading frames for two large proteins, PP1a and PP1ab. Within the two polypeptide stretches, there are two proteases that process the large proteins into 15 discrete proteins essential for the assembly of the virion during its replication. We describe herein the cloning of the genes for these discrete proteins optimized for expression in Escherichia coli, production of the proteins, and their purification to homogeneity. These included all but six: NSP6, which possesses eight transmembrane regions, and five that are small proteins/peptides (E, ORF3b, ORF6, ORF7b, and ORF10). These proteins are intended for experimental validation of small-molecule binders as molecular template hits. The proof of concept was established with the ADP-ribosylhydrolase (ARH) domain of NSP3 in discovery of small-molecule templates that could serve as the basis for further optimization. The hit molecules include one submicromolar and a few low-micromolar binders to the ARH domain. Availability of these proteins in soluble forms opens up the opportunity for discoveries of novel templates with the potential for anti-COVID-19 pharmaceuticals.},

abstract = {The transition from preclinical biological drug development into clinical trials requires an efficient upscaling process. In this context, bispecific antibody drugs are particularly challenging due to their propensity to form aggregates and generally produce low titers. Here, the upscaling process for a tetravalent bispecific antibody expressed by a piggyBac transposon-mediated stable HEK293 cell pool has been evaluated. The project was performed as a case study at Testa Center, a non-GMP facility for scale-up testing of biologics in Sweden, and encompassed media adaptation strategies, fed-batch optimization and a novel antibody purification technology. The cell pool was adapted to different culture media for evaluation in terms of cell viability and titers compared to its original Expi293 Expression Medium. These parameters were assessed in both sequential stepwise adaption and direct media exchanges. By this, a more affordable medium was identified that did not require stepwise adaptation and with similar titers and viability as in the Expi293 Expression Medium. Fed-batch optimizations resulted in culture densities reaching up to 20 × 106 viable cells/mL with over 90 % viability 12 days post-inoculum, and antibody titers three times higher than corresponding batch cultures. By implementing a novel high-speed protein A fiber technology (Fibro PrismA) with a capture residence time of only 7.5 s, 8 L of supernatant could be purified in 4.5 h without compromising the purity, structural integrity and function of the bispecific antibody. Results from this study related to medium adaptation and design of fed-batch protocols will be highly beneficial during the forthcoming scale-up of this therapeutic antibody.},

abstract = {Plant nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors recognize avirulence effectors directly through their integrated domains (IDs) or indirectly via the effector-targeted proteins. Previous studies have succeeded in generating designer NLR receptors with new recognition profiles by engineering IDs or targeted proteins based on prior knowledge of their interactions with the effectors. However, it is yet a challenge to design a new plant receptor capable of recognizing effectors that function by unknown mechanisms. Several rice NLR immune receptors, including RGA5, possess an integrated heavy metal-associated (HMA) domain that recognizes corresponding Magnaporthe oryzae Avrs and ToxB-like (MAX) effectors in the rice blast fungus. Here, we report a designer rice NLR receptor RGA5 HMA2 carrying an engineered , integrated HMA domain (RGA5-HMA2) that can recognize the noncorresponding MAX effector AvrPib and confers the RGA4-dependent resistance to the M. oryzae isolates expressing AvrPib, which originally triggers the Pib-mediated blast resistance via unknown mechanisms. The RGA5-HMA2 domain is contrived based on the high structural similarity of AvrPib with two MAX effectors, AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39, recognized by cognate RGA5-HMA, the binding interface between AVR1-CO39 and RGA5-HMA, and the distinct surface charge of AvrPib and RAG5-HMA. This work demonstrates that rice NLR receptors with the HMA domain can be engineered to confer resistance to the M. oryzae isolates noncorresponding but structurally similar MAX effectors, which manifest cognate NLR receptor-mediated resistance with unknown mechanisms. Our study also provides a practical approach for developing rice multilines and broad race spectrum-resistant cultivars by introducing a series of engineered NLR receptors. NLR immune receptor j integrated domain j recognition j multilines j broad spectrum resistance M any gene-for-gene diseases, in which hosts and pathogens recognize each other by their cognate resistance (R) and avirulence (Avr) proteins, pose a serious threat to global food security. Managing such diseases is cumbersome as R gene-mediated resistance is frequently compromised by virulent races of the pathogens, which are evolved by losing the Avr function of corresponding Avr genes (1). To avert the resistance erosion, several strategies have been proposed, including the utilization of broad, race spectrum-resistant cultivars and mul-tilines, each of which carries a distinct R protein capable of recognizing corresponding Avr proteins in the pathogens (2, 3). Multiline cultivars have been well demonstrated in managing stripe rust and the powdery mildew of wheat (4, 5). However, cultivars with broad race spectrum resistance are very limited, and breeding multilines is time-consuming, expensive, and laborious. The genetic engineering of R genes may address the challenges and accelerate the development of broad, race spectrum-resistant cultivars and multilines. Diverse types of R genes have been identified, one major group of which encodes nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors (6). These NLRs are typically composed of an N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) or Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain, a central nucleotide-binding domain, and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain. Interestingly, many NLR receptors contain an additional integrated domain (ID), such as the heavy metal-associated (HMA) domain or WRKY domain. These IDs determine the specificity of NLR receptors recognizing Avr effectors and thus have been considered as an ideal target for engineering new types of resistance (7-10). As reported, the bacterial protease effector AvrPphB from Pseudomonas syringae cleaves the Arabidopsis thaliana PBS1 to activate the RPS5-dependent resistance (11). The substitution of the AvrPphB cleavage site in PBS1 with that of protease effector AvrRpt2, which originally activates RPS2-mediated resistance, or of tobacco etch virus protease Nia can enable transgenic plants to acquire the resistance to pathogens carrying noncorresponding Avr effectors (9, 12, 13). These examples are achieved based on the prior knowledge of molecular or Significance In this study, we generated a mutant of the rice nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immunity receptor RGA5 by engineering its heavy metal-associated domain that recognizes the noncorresponding Magnaporthe oryzae Avrs-and ToxB-like effector AvrPib and confers resistance in transgenic rice to the blast fungus isolates with AvrPib, which is known to trigger blast resistance in rice cultivars carrying the R gene Pib, albeit by unknown mechanisms. Thus, this work demonstrates that integrated domain-containing plant NLR receptors can be engineered to confer resistance to pathogens carrying avirulence effectors that trigger plant immunity by unknown mechanisms, thereby providing a practical approach for developing multilines and cultivars with broad race spectrum resistance.},

abstract = {The mechanism of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-mediated phagocytosis remains unknown. Here, we found that S1P or FTY720 (an analog of S1P) promoted microglial phagocytosis in stroke independent of S1PRs. First, we used computer simulation of molecular docking to predict that S1P might be a ligand for triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2). Next, microscale thermophoresis (MST), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) were performed to reveal that S1P was a novel TREM2 ligand. Then, we confirmed the pro-phagocytosis of S1P targeting in Trem2-Dap12 transfected CHO cells and TREM2 knockdown microglia. Point mutation analysis showed that D104 was the critical binding residue. Trem2−/− mice were used to demonstrate the role of S1P-induced phagocytosis targeting on TREM2 in protecting against ischemic brain injury. Finally, further studies revealed that apolipoprotein E (APOE) loaded with S1P was released by microglia and bound to apoptotic neurons via LDL receptor related protein 1B (LRP1B) and thereby induced microglia to phagocytose apoptotic neurons. Overall, the present work reveals for the first time that S1P acts as a novel endogenous ligand of TREM2 to effectively promote microglial phagocytosis. Our findings provide a new lead compound for developing immunomodulator targeting on TREM2.},

However, recombinantly expressed soluble E proteins are monomers under vaccination conditions and do not present these quaternary epitopes, partly explaining their limited success as vaccine antigens. Using molecular modeling, we found DENV2 E protein mutations that induce dimerization at low concentrations (<100 pM) and enhance production yield by more than 50-fold. Cross-dimer epitope antibodies bind to the stabilized dimers, and a crystal structure resembles the wild-type (WT) E protein bound to a dimer epitope antibody. Mice immunized with the stabilized dimers developed antibodies that bind to E dimers and not monomers and elicited higher levels of DENV2-neutralizing antibodies compared to mice immunized with WT E antigen. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using structure-based design to produce subunit vaccines for dengue and other flaviviruses.},

Recently, we could reveal that cold adaptation of such a polymerase is not only achieved at the expense of enzyme stability, but also at the cost of polymerization fidelity. Enzymes from psychrophilic organisms usually show an increased structural flexibility to enable catalysis at low temperatures. Here, polymerases face a dilemma, as there is a discrepancy between the need for a tightly controlled flexibility during polymerization and an increased flexibility as strategy for cold adaptation. Based on structural and biochemical analyses, we contribute to clarify the cold adaptation strategy of the psychrophilic CCA-adding enzyme from Planococcus halocryophilus, a gram-positive bacterium thriving in the arctic permafrost at low temperatures down to −15 °C. A comparison with the closely related enzyme from the thermophilic bacterium Geobacillus stearothermophilus reveals several features of cold adaptation - a significantly reduced amount of alpha-helical elements in the C-terminal tRNA-binding region and a structural adaptation in one of the highly conserved catalytic core motifs located in the N-terminal catalytic core of the enzyme.},

Altering functionally essential allosteric residue networks provides unique protein family subtype specificity, minimizes unwanted off-target effects, and helps avert resistance acquisition typically plaguing drugs that target orthosteric sites. In this work, we used protein engineering and dimer interface mutations to positively and negatively modulate the immunosuppressive activity of the proapoptotic human galectin-7 (GAL-7). Using the PoPMuSiC and BeAtMuSiC algorithms, mutational sites and residue identity were computationally probed and predicted to either alter or stabilize the GAL-7 dimer interface. By designing a covalent disulfide bridge between protomers to control homodimer strength and stability, we demonstrate the importance of dimer interface perturbations on the allosteric network bridging the two opposite glycan-binding sites on GAL-7, resulting in control of induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells. Molecular investigation of G16X GAL-7 variants using X-ray crystallography, biophysical, and computational characterization illuminates residues involved in dimer stability and allosteric communication, along with discrete long-range dynamic behaviors involving loops 1, 3, and 5. We show that perturbing the protein-protein interface between GAL-7 protomers can modulate its biological function, even when the overall structure and ligand-binding affinity remains unaltered. This study highlights new avenues for the design of galectin-specific modulators influencing both glycandependent and glycan-independent interactions.},

abstract = {Cyclic-di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is an important nucleotide signaling molecule that plays a key role in osmotic regulation in bacteria. c-di-AMP is produced from two molecules of ATP by proteins containing a diadenylate cyclase (DAC) domain. In Bacillus subtilis, the main c-di-AMP cyclase, CdaA, is a membrane-linked cyclase with an N-terminal transmembrane domain followed by the cytoplasmic DAC domain. As both high and low levels of c-di-AMP have a negative impact on bacterial growth, the cellular levels of this signaling nucleotide are tightly regulated. Here we investigated how the activity of the B. subtilis CdaA is regulated by the phosphoglucomutase GlmM, which has been shown to interact with the c-di-AMP cyclase. Using the soluble B. subtilis CdaACD catalytic domain and purified full-length GlmM or the GlmMF369 variant lacking the C-terminal flexible domain 4, we show that the cyclase and phosphoglucomutase form a stable complex in vitro and that GlmM is a potent cyclase inhibitor. We determined the crystal structure of the individual B. subtilis CdaACD and GlmM homodimers and of the CdaACD:GlmMF369 complex. In the complex structure, a CdaACD dimer is bound to a GlmMF369 dimer in such a manner that GlmM blocks the oligomerization of CdaACD and formation of active head-to-head cyclase oligomers, thus suggesting a mechanism by which GlmM acts as a cyclase inhibitor. As the amino acids at the CdaACD:GlmM interphase are conserved, we propose that the observed mechanism of inhibition of CdaA by GlmM may also be conserved among Firmicutes.},

12 (FKBP12) inhibits mTOR kinase activity via direct association. The FKBP12- mTOR association can be strengthened by the immunosuppressant rapamycin,
but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. We show here that the FKBP12- mTOR association is tightly regulated by an acetylation–deacetylation cycle. FKBP12 is acetylated on the lysine cluster (K45/K48/K53) by CREB-binding protein (CBP) in mammalian cells in response to nutrient treatment. Acetyl-FKBP12 associates with CBP acetylated Rheb. Rapamycin recruits SIRT2 with a high affinity for FKBP12 association and deacetylation. SIRT2-deacetylated FKBP12 then switches its association from Rheb to mTOR. Nutrient-activated mTOR phosphorylates IRF3S386 for the antiviral response. In contrast, rapamycin strengthening FKBP12-mTOR association blocks mTOR antiviral activity by recruiting SIRT2 to deacetylate FKBP12. Hence, on/off mTOR activity in response to environmental nutrients relies on FKBP12 acetylation and deacetylation status in mammalian cells.},

abstract = {Rifamycins, such as rifampicin (Rif), are potent inhibitors of bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) and are widely used antibiotics. Rifamycin resistance is usually associated with mutations in RNAP that preclude rifamycin binding. However, some bacteria have a type of ADP-ribosyl transferases, Arr, which ADP-ribosylate rifamycin molecules, thus inactivating their antimicrobial activity. Here, we directly show that ADP-ribosylation abolishes inhibition of transcription by rifampicin, the most widely used rifamycin antibiotic. We also show that a natural rifamycin, kanglemycin A (KglA), which has a unique sugar moiety at the ansa chain close to the Arr modification site, does not bind to Arr from Mycobacterium smegmatis and thus is not susceptible to inactivation. We, found, however, that kanglemycin A can still be ADP-ribosylated by the Arr of an emerging pathogen, Mycobacterium abscessus. Interestingly, the only part of Arr that exhibits no homology between the species is the part that sterically clashes with the sugar moiety of kanglemycin A in M. smegmatis Arr. This suggests that M. abscessus has encountered KglA or rifamycin with a similar sugar modification in the course of evolution.

abstract = {Membrane proteins, found at the junctions between the outside world and the inner workings of the cell, play important roles in human disease and are used as biosensors. More than half of all therapeutics directly affect membrane protein function while nanopores enable DNA sequencing. The structural and functional characterisation of membrane proteins is therefore crucial. However, low levels of naturally abundant protein and the hydrophobic nature of membrane proteins makes production difficult. To maximise success, high-throughput strategies were developed that rely upon simple screens to identify successful constructs and rapidly exclude those unlikely to work. Parameters that affect production such as expression host, membrane protein origin, expression vector, fusion-tags, encapsulation reagent and solvent composition are screened in parallel. In this way, constructs with divergent requirements can be produced for a variety of structural applications. As structural techniques advance, sample requirements will change. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy requires less protein than crystallography and as cryo-electron tomography and time-resolved serial crystallography are developed new sample production requirements will evolve. Here we discuss different methods used for the high-throughput production of membrane proteins for structural biology.},

abstract = {Sexual reproduction is an essential stage of the oomycete life cycle. However, the functions of critical regulators in this biological process remain unclear due to a lack of genome editing technologies and functional genomic studies in oomycetes. The notorious oomycete pathogen Pythium ultimum is responsible for a variety of diseases in a broad range of plant species. In this study, we revealed the mechanism through which PuM90, a stage-specific Puf family RNA-binding protein, regulates oospore formation in P. ultimum. We developed the first CRISPR/Cas9 system-mediated gene knockout and in situ complementation methods for Pythium. PuM90-knockout mutants were significantly defective in oospore formation, with empty oogonia or oospores larger in size with thinner oospore walls compared with the wild type. A tripartite recognition motif (TRM) in the Puf domain of PuM90 could specifically bind to a UGUACAUA motif in the mRNA 30 untranslated region (UTR) of PuFLP, which encodes a flavodoxin-like protein, and thereby repress PuFLP mRNA level to facilitate oospore formation. Phenotypes similar to PuM90-knockout mutants were observed with overexpression of PuFLP, mutation of key amino acids in the TRM of PuM90, or mutation of the 30-UTR binding site in PuFLP. The results demonstrated that a specific interaction of the RNA-binding protein PuM90 with the 30-UTR of PuFLP mRNA at the post-transcriptional regulation level is critical for the sexual reproduction of P. ultimum.},

abstract = {In humans, there are two forms of glutaminase (GLS), designated GLS1 and GLS2. These enzymes catalyse the conversion of glutamine to glutamate. GLS1 exists as two isozymes: kidney glutaminase (KGA) and glutaminase C (GAC). Several GLS inhibitors have been identified, of which DON (6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine), BPTES (bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1, 3, 4-thiadiazol-2-yl) ethyl sulphide), 968 (5-(3-Bromo-4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)-2,2-dimethyl-2,3,5,6-tetrahydrobenzo[a]phenanthridin-4(1H)-one) and CB839 (Telaglenastat) are the most widely used. However, these inhibitors have variable efficacy, specificity and bioavailability in research and clinical settings, implying the need for novel and improved GLS inhibitors. Based on this need, a diverse library of 28,000 compounds from Enamine was screened for inhibition of recombinant, purified GAC. From this library, one inhibitor designated compound 19 (C19) was identified with kinetic features revealing allosteric inhibition of GAC in the µm range. Moreover, C19 inhibits anti-CD3/CD28-induced CD4+ T-cell proliferation and cytokine production with similar or greater potency as compared to BPTES. Taken together, our data suggest that C19 has the potential to modulate GLS1 activity and alter metabolic activity of T cells.},

abstract = {Epigenetic research holds great promise to advance our understanding of biomarkers and regulatory processes in health and disease. An increasing number of new approaches, ranging from molecular to biophysical analyses, enable identifying epigenetic changes on the level of a single gene or the whole epigenome. The aim of this review is to highlight how the field is shifting from completely molecular-biology-driven solutions to multidisciplinary strategies including more reliance on biophysical analysis tools. Biophysics not only offers technical advancements in imaging or structure analysis but also helps to explore regulatory interactions. New computational methods are also being developed to meet the demand of growing data volumes and their processing. Therefore, it is important to capture these new directions in epigenetics from a biophysical perspective and discuss current challenges as well as multiple applications of biophysical methods and tools. Specifically, we gradually introduce different biophysical research methods by first considering the DNA-level information and eventually higher-order chromatin structures. Moreover, we aim to highlight that the incorporation of bioinformatics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence into biophysical analysis allows gaining new insights into complex epigenetic processes. The gained understanding has already proven useful in translational and clinical research providing better patient stratification options or new therapeutic insights. Together, this offers a better readiness to transform bench-top experiments into industrial high-throughput applications with a possibility to employ developed methods in clinical practice and diagnostics},

Here, we report two structures of nsp16/nsp10 representing pre- and post-release states of the RNA product (Cap-1). We observe overall widening of the enzyme upon product formation, and an inward twisting motion in the substrate binding region upon product release. These conformational changes reset the enzyme for the next round of catalysis. The structures also identify a unique binding mode and the importance of a divalent metal ion for 2′-O methylation. We also describe underlying structural basis for the perturbed enzymatic activity of a clinical variant of SARS-CoV-2, and a previous SARS-CoV outbreak strain.},

We report three structures of the Cys-loop 5-HT3A serotonin receptor (5HT3R) reconstituted into saposin-based lipid bilayer discs: a symmetric and an asymmetric apo state, and an asymmetric agonist-bound state. In comparison to previously published 5HT3R conformations in detergent, the lipid bilayer stabilises the receptor in a more tightly packed, ‘coupled' state, involving a cluster of highly conserved residues. In consequence, the agonist-bound receptor conformation adopts a wide-open pore capable of conducting sodium ions in unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Taken together, we provide a structural basis for the modulation of 5HT3R by the membrane environment, and a model for asymmetric activation of the receptor.},

abstract = {The design of allosteric modulators to control protein function is a key objective in drug discovery programs. Altering functionally essential allosteric residue networks provides unique protein family subtype specificity, minimizes unwanted off-target effects, and helps avert resistance acquisition typically plaguing drugs that target orthosteric sites. In this work, we used protein engineering and dimer interface mutations to positively and negatively modulate the immunosuppressive activity of the pro-apoptotic human galectin-7 (GAL-7). Using the PoPMuSiC and BeAtMuSiC algorithms, mutational sites and residue identity were computationally probed and predicted to either alter or stabilize the GAL-7 dimer interface. By designing a covalent disulfide bridge between protomers to control homodimer strength and stability, we demonstrate the importance of dimer interface perturbations on the allosteric network bridging the two opposite glycan binding sites on GAL-7, resulting in control of induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells. Molecular investigation of G16X GAL-7 variants using X-ray crystallography, biophysical, and computational characterization illuminates residues involved in dimer stability and allosteric communication, along with discrete long-range dynamic behaviors involving loops 1, 3 and 5. We show that perturbing the protein-protein interface between GAL-7 protomers can modulate its biological function, even when the overall structure and ligand binding affinity remains unaltered. This study highlights new avenues for the design of galectin-specific modulators influencing both glycan-dependent and glycan-independent interactions.},

Guided by physical chemical principles, we covalently conjugated 5′ terminal modified CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to a site-specifically modified Cas12a through biorthogonal chemical reaction. The genome editing efficiency of the resulting conjugated Cas12a complex (cCas12a) was substantially higher than that of the wild-type complex. We also demonstrated that cCas12a could be used for precise gene knockin and multiplex gene editing in a chimeric antigen receptor T cell preparation with efficiency much higher than that of the wild-type system. Overall, our findings indicate that covalently linking Cas nuclease and crRNA is an effective approach to improve the Cas12a-based genome editing system and could potentially provide an insight into engineering other Cas family members with low efficiency as well.},

We study two novel marine-organism TALE-like proteins (MOrTL1 and MOrTL2), the first to date of non-terrestrial origin. We have assessed their DNA-binding properties and modelled repeat structures. We found that repeats from these proteins mediate sequence specific DNA binding conforming to the TALE code, despite low sequence similarity to TALE repeats, and with novel residues around the BSR. However, MOrTL1 repeats show greater sequence discriminating power than MOrTL2 repeats. Sequence alignments show that there are only three residues conserved between repeats of all TALE-like proteins including the two new additions. This conserved motif could prove useful as an identifier for future TALE-likes. Additionally, comparing MOrTL repeats with those of other TALE-likes suggests a common evolutionary origin for the TALEs, RipTALs and Bats.},

However, unlocking the potential of PROTACs necessitates drug discovery techniques that can support the complexity of the novel MOA. In this chapter, we describe the application of MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) and Temperature-Related Intensity Change (TRIC) to characterize both the binary and ternary binding of PROTACs with target proteins and ubiquitin ligases along with an efficient determination of the cooperativity of the ternary complex formation. The assay development and experimental procedure to characterize the well-described BET PROTAC MZ1 show how MST and TRIC can be applied as a fast and highly sensitive method for PROTAC discovery.},

Due to their broad reactivity and potential toxicity, the biosynthesis and breakdown of H2S, NO, and CO are tightly regulated. Growing evidence highlights the active role of gasotransmitters in their mutual cross-regulation. In human physiology, the transsulfuration enzymes cystathionine $\beta$-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine $\gamma$-lyase (CSE) are prominent H2S enzymatic sources. While CBS is known to be inhibited by NO and CO, little is known about CSE regulation by gasotransmitters. Herein, we investigated the effect of s-nitrosation on CSE catalytic activity. H2S production by recombinant human CSE was found to be inhibited by the physiological nitrosating agent s-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), while reduced glutathione had no effect. GSNO-induced inhibition was partially reverted by ascorbate and accompanied by the disappearance of one solvent accessible protein thiol. By combining differential derivatization procedures and mass spectrometry-based analysis with functional assays, seven out of the ten protein cysteine residues, namely Cys84, Cys109, Cys137, Cys172, Cys229, Cys307, and Cys310, were identified as targets of s-nitrosation. By generating conservative Cys-to-Ser variants of the identified s-nitrosated cysteines, Cys137 was identified as most significantly contributing to the GSNO-mediated CSE inhibition. These results highlight a new mechanism of crosstalk between gasotransmitters.},

abstract = {Membrane proteins have a range of crucial biological functions and are the target of about 60% of all prescribed drugs. For most studies, they need to be extracted out of the lipid-bilayer, e.g. by detergent solubilisation, leading to the loss of native lipids, which may disturb important protein-lipid/bilayer interactions and thus functional and structural integrity. Relipidation of membrane proteins has proven extremely successful for studying challenging targets, but the identification of suitable lipids can be expensive and laborious. Therefore, we developed a screen to aid the high-throughput identification of beneficial lipids. The screen covers a large lipid space and was designed to be suitable for a range of stability assessment methods. Here, we demonstrate its use as a tool for identifying stabilising lipids for three membrane proteins: a bacterial pyrophosphatase (Tm-PPase), a fungal purine transporter (UapA) and a human GPCR (A2AR). A2AR is stabilised by cholesteryl hemisuccinate, a lipid well known to stabilise GPCRs, validating the approach. Additionally, our screen also identified a range of new lipids which stabilised our test proteins, providing a starting point for further investigation and demonstrating its value as a novel tool for membrane protein research. The pre-dispensed screen will be made commercially available to the scientific community in future and has a number of potential applications in the field.},

abstract = {Degrading pathogenic proteins by degrader technologies such as PROTACs (proteolysis-targeting chimeras) provides promising therapeutic strategies, but selective degradation of non-protein pathogenic biomolecules has been challenging. Here, we demonstrate a novel strategy to degrade non-protein biomolecules by autophagy-tethering compounds (ATTECs), using lipid droplets (LDs) as an exemplar target. LDs are ubiquitous cellular structures storing lipids and could be degraded by autophagy. We hypothesized that compounds interacting with both the LDs and the key autophagosome protein LC3 may enhance autophagic degradation of LDs. We designed and synthesized such compounds by connecting LC3-binding molecules to LD-binding probes via a linker. These compounds were capable of clearing LDs almost completely and rescued LD-related phenotypes in cells and in two independent mouse models with hepatic lipidosis. We further confirmed that the mechanism of action of these compounds was mediated through LC3 and autophagic degradation. Our proof-of-concept study demonstrates the capability of degrading LDs by ATTECs. Conceptually, this strategy could be applied to other protein and non-protein targets.},

abstract = {Accumulation of mutant proteins is a major cause of many diseases (collectively called proteopathies), and lowering the level of these proteins can be useful for treatment of these diseases. We hypothesized that compounds that interact with both the autophagosome protein microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3)1 and the disease-causing protein may target the latter for autophagic clearance. Mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) contains an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract and causes Huntington's disease, an incurable neurodegenerative disorder2. Here, using small-molecule-microarray-based screening, we identified four compounds that interact with both LC3 and mHTT, but not with the wild-type HTT protein. Some of these compounds targeted mHTT to autophagosomes, reduced mHTT levels in an allele-selective manner, and rescued disease-relevant phenotypes in cells and in vivo in fly and mouse models of Huntington's disease. We further show that these compounds interact with the expanded polyQ stretch and could lower the level of mutant ataxin-3 (ATXN3), another disease-causing protein with an expanded polyQ tract3. This study presents candidate compounds for lowering mHTT and potentially other disease-causing proteins with polyQ expansions, demonstrating the concept of lowering levels of disease-causing proteins using autophagosome-tethering compounds. Compounds that interact with mutant huntingtin and an autophagosomal protein are able to reduce cellular levels of mutant huntingtin by targeting it for autophagic degradation, demonstrating an approach that may have potential for treating proteopathies.},

abstract = {Biopharmaceuticals such as protein and peptide-based drugs are often produced by fermentation processes where it is necessary to monitor the amount and quality of the product expressed during fermentation and for release testing of the final drug product. Standard procedures involve surface-based ligand binding technologies such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and biolayer interferometry, or extensive purification using, e.g., preparative chromatography followed by spectrophotometric protein quantification. The multistep nature of these methodologies leads to lengthy protocols and renders real-time process control impractical. Recently, flow-induced dispersion analysis (FIDA) was introduced as a novel in-solution ligand binding technology, requiring only nano/microliter sample volumes. FIDA is based on Taylor dispersion analysis in narrow fused silica capillaries and provides the hydrodynamic radius of the binding ligand and complex in addition to the detailed binding characterization. Here, we demonstrate the use of FIDA for quantification of monoclonal IgG antibodies (rituximab) directly in mammalian cell fermentation broth with only 4 min of analysis time. The FIDA assay utilizes a small anti-IgG affibody, conjugated to a fluorophore, as a selective rituximab binder. The apparent change in the hydrodynamic radius of the affibody, as it interacts with known concentrations of rituximab, is used for generating a binding curve in a blank fermentation medium, and hence determining the dissociation constant and complex size. Finally, the binding curve is utilized for quantifying the rituximab titer concentration in clarified fermentation broth samples.},

abstract = {Microscale thermophoresis (MST) is a versatile technique to measure binding affinities of binder–ligand systems, based on the directional movement of molecules in a temperature gradient. We extended MST to measure binding kinetics as well as binding affinity in a single experiment by increasing the thermal dissipation of the sample. The kinetic relaxation fingerprints were derived from the fluorescence changes during thermodynamic re-equilibration of the sample after local heating. Using this method, we measured DNA hybridization on-rates and off-rates in the range 104–106 m−1 s−1 and 10−4–10−1 s−1, respectively. We observed the expected exponential dependence of the DNA hybridization off-rates on salt concentration, strand length and inverse temperature. The measured on-rates showed a linear dependence on salt concentration and weak dependence on strand length and temperature. For biomolecular interactions with large enthalpic contributions, the kinetic MST technique offers a robust, cost-effective and immobilization-free determination of kinetic rates and binding affinity simultaneously, even in crowded solutions.},

In the Pack-alone scenario, similar emotional spaces and sample configurations were obtained with both images and words. In the Pack-and-tasting scenario, the richness of the emotional response increased when using images. In both scenarios, the participants used a greater number of negative emotions when these were presented as images rather than as words.

In the present study, we described a novel cancer detection method based on plasma denaturation profiles obtained by a non-conventional use of differential scanning fluorimetry. Using blood samples from 84 glioma patients and 63 healthy controls, we showed that their denaturation profiles can be automatically distinguished with the help of machine learning algorithms with 92% accuracy. Proposed high throughput workflow can be applied to any type of cancer and could become a powerful pan-cancer diagnostic and monitoring tool requiring only a simple blood test.},

abstract = {Background: Aberrant changes in epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications play an important role in cancer progression. PRMT1 which triggers asymmetric dimethylation of histone H4 on arginine 3 (H4R3me2a) is upregulated in human colorectal cancer (CRC) and is essential for cell proliferation. However, how this dysregulated modification might contribute to malignant transitions of CRC remains poorly understood. Methods: In this study, we integrated biochemical assays including protein interaction studies and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), cellular analysis including cell viability, proliferation, colony formation, and migration assays, clinical sample analysis, microarray experiments, and ChIP-Seq data to investigate the potential genomic recognition pattern of H4R3me2s in CRC cells and its effect on CRC progression. Results: We show that PRMT1 and SMARCA4, an ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, act cooperatively to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. We find that SMARCA4 is a novel effector molecule of PRMT1-mediated H4R3me2a. Mechanistically, we show that H4R3me2a directly recruited SMARCA4 to promote the proliferative, colony-formative, and migratory abilities of CRC cells by enhancing EGFR signaling. We found that EGFR and TNS4 were major direct downstream transcriptional targets of PRMT1 and SMARCA4 in colon cells, and acted in a PRMT1 methyltransferase activity-dependent manner to promote CRC cell proliferation. In vivo, knockdown or inhibition of PRMT1 profoundly attenuated the growth of CRC cells in the C57BL/6 J-ApcMin/+ CRC mice model. Importantly, elevated expression of PRMT1 or SMARCA4 in CRC patients were positively correlated with expression of EGFR and TNS4, and CRC patients had shorter overall survival. These findings reveal a critical interplay between epigenetic and transcriptional control during CRC progression, suggesting that SMARCA4 is a novel key epigenetic modulator of CRC. Our findings thus highlight PRMT1/SMARCA4 inhibition as a potential therapeutic intervention strategy for CRC. Conclusion: PRMT1-mediated H4R3me2a recruits SMARCA4, which promotes colorectal cancer progression by enhancing EGFR signaling.},

Here, we investigated the skeletal muscle transcriptional program and identified key tissue-specific regulatory genetic elements. Our results show that Myod1 is bound to numerous skeletal muscle enhancers in collaboration with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to control gene expression. Remarkably, transcriptional activation controlled by these factors occurs through direct contacts with the promoter region of target genes, via the CpG-bound transcription factor Nrf1, and the formation of Ctcf-anchored chromatin loops, in a myofiber-specific manner. Moreover, we demonstrate that GR negatively controls muscle mass and strength in mice by down-regulating anabolic pathways. Taken together, our data establish Myod1, GR and Nrf1 as key players of muscle-specific enhancer-promoter communication that orchestrate myofiber size regulation.},

Unfortunately, currently, there is no specific and effective treatment for COVID-19. As SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike proteins (S) to bind to a host cell-surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2(ACE2), and this interaction is proved to be responsible for entering a virus into host cells, it makes an ideal target for antiviral drug development. In this work, we design three very short peptides based on the ACE2 sequence/structure fragments, which may effectively bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein and may, in turn, disrupt the important virus-host protein–protein interactions, blocking early steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two of our peptides bind to virus protein with affinity in nanomolar range, and as very short peptides have great potential for drug development.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Caveolae proteins play diverse roles in cancer development and progression. In prostate cancer, non-caveolar caveolin-1 (CAV1) promotes metastasis, while CAVIN1 attenuates CAV1-induced metastasis. Here, we unveil a novel mechanism linking CAV1 to selective loading of exosomes with metastasis-promoting microRNAs. RESULTS: We identify hnRNPK as a CAV1-regulated microRNA binding protein. In the absence of CAVIN1, non-caveolar CAV1 drives localisation of hnRPNK to multi-vesicular bodies (MVBs), recruiting AsUGnA motif-containing miRNAs and causing their release within exosomes. This process is dependent on the lipid environment of membranes as shown by cholesterol depletion using methyl-{\ss}-cyclodextrin or by treatment with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Consistent with a role in bone metastasis, knockdown of hnRNPK in prostate cancer PC3 cells abolished the ability of PC3 extracellular vesicles (EV) to induce osteoclastogenesis, and biofluid EV hnRNPK is elevated in metastatic prostate and colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results support a novel pan-cancer mechanism for CAV1-driven exosomal release of hnRNPK and associated miRNA in metastasis, which is modulated by the membrane lipid environment.},

abstract = {The understanding and characterization of protein interactions is crucial for elucidation of complicated biomolecular processes as well as for the development of new biopharmaceutical therapies. Often, protein interactions involve multiple binding, avidity, oligomerization, and are dependent on the local environment. Current analytical methodologies are unable to provide a detailed mechanistic characterization considering all these parameters, since they often rely on surface immobilization, cannot measure under biorelevant conditions, or do not feature a structurally-related readout for indicating formation of multiple bound species. In this work, we report the use of flow induced dispersion analysis (FIDA) for in-solution characterization of complex protein interactions under in vivo like conditions. FIDA is an immobilization-free ligand binding methodology employing Taylor dispersion analysis for measuring the hydrodynamic radius (size) of biomolecular complexes. Here, the FIDA technology is utilized for a size-based characterization of the interaction between TNF-$\alpha$ and adalimumab. We report concentration-dependent complex sizes, binding affinities (Kd), kinetics, and higher order stoichiometries, thus providing essential information on the TNF-$\alpha$–adalimumab binding mechanism. Furthermore, it is shown that the avidity stabilized complexes involving formation of multiple non-covalent bonds are formed on a longer timescale than the primary complexes formed in a simple 1 to 1 binding event.},

abstract = {Cancer is a genetic disease caused by changes in gene expression resulting from somatic mutations and epigenetic changes. Although the probability of mutations is proportional with cell number and replication cycles, large bodied species do not develop cancer more frequently than smaller ones. This notion is known as Peto's paradox, and assumes stronger tumor suppression in larger animals. One of the possible tumor suppressor mechanisms involved could be replicative senescence caused by telomere shortening in the absence of telomerase activity. We analysed telomerase promoter activity and transcription factor binding in mammals to identify the key element of telomerase gene inactivation. We found that the GABPA transcription factor plays a key role in TERT regulation in somatic cells of small rodents, but its binding site is absent in larger beavers. Protein binding and reporter gene assays verify different use of this site in different species. The presence or absence of the GABPA TF site in TERT promoters of rodents correlates with TERT promoter activity; thus it could determine whether replicative senescence plays a tumor suppressor role in these species, which could be in direct relation with body mass. The GABPA TF binding sites that contribute to TERT activity in somatic cells of rodents are analogous to those mutated in human tumors, which activate telomerase by a non-ALT mechanism.},

In this study, we designed three different RBD-conjugated nanoparticle vaccine candidates, namely, RBD-Ferritin (24-mer), RBD-mi3 (60-mer), and RBD-I53−50 (120-mer), via covalent conjugation using the SpyTag-SpyCatcher system. When mice were immunized with the RBD-conjugated nanoparticles (NPs) in conjunction with the AddaVax or Sigma Adjuvant System, the resulting antisera exhibited 8- to 120-fold greater neutralizing activity against both a pseudovirus and the authentic virus than those of mice immunized with monomeric RBD. Most importantly, sera from mice immunized with RBD-conjugated NPs more efficiently blocked the binding of RBD to ACE2 in vitro, further corroborating the promising immunization effect. Additionally, the vaccine has distinct advantages in terms of a relatively simple scale-up and flexible assembly. These results illustrate that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-conjugated nanoparticles developed in this study are a competitive vaccine candidate and that the carrier nanoparticles could be adopted as a universal platform for a future vaccine development.},

abstract = {<p>The reverse transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) initiates upon annealing of the 3′-18-nt of tRNALys3 onto the primer binding site (PBS) in viral RNA (vRNA). Additional intermolecular interactions between tRNALys3 and vRNA have been reported, but their functions remain unclear. Here, we show that abolishing one potential interaction, the A-rich loop: tRNALys3 anticodon interaction in the HIV-1 MAL strain, led to a decrease in viral infectivity and reduced the synthesis of reverse transcription products in newly infected cells. In vitro biophysical and functional experiments revealed that disruption of the extended interaction resulted in an increased affinity for reverse transcriptase (RT) and enhanced primer extension efficiency. In the absence of deoxyribose nucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), vRNA was degraded by the RNaseH activity of RT, and the degradation rate was slower in the complex with the extended interaction. Consistently, the loss of vRNA integrity was detected in virions containing A-rich loop mutations. Similar results were observed in the HIV-1 NL4.3 strain, and we show that the nucleocapsid (NC) protein is necessary to promote the extended vRNA: tRNALys3 interactions in vitro. In summary, our data revealed that the additional intermolecular interaction between tRNALys3 and vRNA is likely a conserved mechanism among various HIV-1 strains and protects the vRNA from RNaseH degradation in mature virions.</p>},

abstract = {Histone methyltransferases of the nuclear receptor-binding SET domain protein (NSD) family, including NSD1, NSD2 and NSD3, have crucial roles in chromatin regulation and are implicated in oncogenesis1,2. NSD enzymes exhibit an autoinhibitory state that is relieved by binding to nucleosomes, enabling dimethylation of histone H3 at Lys36 (H3K36)3–7. However, the molecular basis that underlies this mechanism is largely unknown. Here we solve the cryo-electron microscopy structures of NSD2 and NSD3 bound to mononucleosomes. We find that binding of NSD2 and NSD3 to mononucleosomes causes DNA near the linker region to unwrap, which facilitates insertion of the catalytic core between the histone octamer and the unwrapped segment of DNA. A network of DNA- and histone-specific contacts between NSD2 or NSD3 and the nucleosome precisely defines the position of the enzyme on the nucleosome, explaining the specificity of methylation to H3K36. Intermolecular contacts between NSD proteins and nucleosomes are altered by several recurrent cancer-associated mutations in NSD2 and NSD3. NSDs that contain these mutations are catalytically hyperactive in vitro and in cells, and their ectopic expression promotes the proliferation of cancer cells and the growth of xenograft tumours. Together, our research provides molecular insights into the nucleosome-based recognition and histone-modification mechanisms of NSD2 and NSD3, which could lead to strategies for therapeutic targeting of proteins of the NSD family.},

abstract = {Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus from the Bunyaviridae family that causes high rates of mortality and morbidity in humans and ruminant animals. Previous studies indicated that DEAD-box helicase 17 (DDX17) restricts RVFV replication by recognizing two primary non-coding RNAs in the S-segment of the genome: the intergenic region (IGR) and 50 non-coding region (NCR). However, we lack molecular insights into the direct binding of DDX17 with RVFV non-coding RNAs and information on the unwinding of both non-coding RNAs by DDX17. Therefore, we performed an extensive biophysical analysis of the DDX17 helicase domain (DDX17135–555) and RVFV non-coding RNAs, IGR and 5' NCR. The homogeneity studies using analytical ultracentrifugation indicated that DDX17135–555, IGR, and 5' NCR are pure. Next, we performed small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments, which suggested that DDX17 and both RNAs are homogenous as well. SAXS analysis also demonstrated that DDX17 is globular to an extent, whereas the RNAs adopt an extended conformation in solution. Subsequently, microscale thermophoresis (MST) experiments were performed to investigate the direct binding of DDX17 to the non-coding RNAs. The MST experiments demonstrated that DDX17 binds with the IGR and 5' NCR with a dissociation constant of 5.77 ± 0.15 µM and 9.85 ± 0.11 µM, respectively. As DDX17135–555 is an RNA helicase, we next determined if it could unwind IGR and NCR. We developed a helicase assay using MST and fluorescently-labeled oligos, which suggested DDX17135–555 can unwind both RNAs. Overall, our study provides direct evidence of DDX17135–555 interacting with and unwinding RVFV non-coding regions},

abstract = {$\alpha$ 1 -Microglobulin (A1M) is a small glycoprotein that belongs to the lipocalin protein family. A major biological role of A1M is to protect cells and tissues against oxidative damage by clearing free heme and reactive oxygen species. Because of this, the protein has attracted great interest as a potential pharmaceutical candidate for treatment of acute kidney injury and preeclampsia. The aim of this study was to explore the possibility of expressing human A1M in plants through transient gene expression, as an alternative or complement to other expression systems. E. coli , insect and mammalian cell culture have previously been used for recombinant A1M (rA1M) or A1M production, but these systems have various drawbacks, including additional complication and expense in refolding for E. coli , while insect produced rA1M is heavily modified with chromophores and mammalian cell culture has been used only in analytical scale. For that purpose, we have used a viral vector (pJL-TRBO) delivered by Agrobacterium for expression of three modified A1M gene variants in the leaves of N. benthamiana . The results showed that these modified rA1M protein variants, A1M-NB1, A1M-NB2 and A1M-NB3, targeted to the cytosol, ER and extracellular space, respectively, were successfully expressed in the leaves, which was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The cytosol accumulated A1M-NB1 was selected for further analysis, as it appeared to have a higher yield than the other variants, and was purified with a yield of ca. 50 mg/kg leaf. The purified protein had the expected structural and functional properties, displaying heme-binding capacity and capacity of protecting red blood cells against stress-induced cell death. The protein also carried bound chromophores, a characteristic feature of A1M and an indicator of a capacity to bind small molecules. The study showed that expression of the functional protein in N. benthamiana may be an attractive alternative for production of rA1M for pharmaceutical purposes and a basis for future research on A1M structure and function.},

The 5՛ terminal regions (TR) of flaviviruses interact with human proteins and such interactions are critical for viral replication. One of the human proteins identified to interact with the 5՛ TR of JEV is the DEAD-box helicase, DDX3X. In this study, we in vitro transcribed the 50 TR of JEV and demonstrated its direct interaction with recombinant DDX3X (Kd of 1.66 0.21 $\mu$M) using microscale thermophoresis (MST). Due to the proposed structural similarities of 5՛ and 3՛ TRs of flaviviruses, we investigated if the ZIKV 50 TR could also interact with human DDX3X. Our MST studies suggested that DDX3X recognizes ZIKV 50 TR with a Kd of 7.05 0.75 $\mu$M. Next, we performed helicase assays that suggested that the binding of DDX3X leads to the unwinding of JEV and ZIKV 5՛ TRs. Overall, our data indicate, for the first time, that DDX3X can directly bind and unwind in vitro transcribed flaviviral TRs. In summary, our work indicates that DDX3X could be further explored as a therapeutic target to inhibit Flaviviral replication.},

abstract = {The members of the avidin protein family are well known for their high affinity towards d-biotin and their structural stability. These properties make avidins a valuable tool for various biotechnological applications. In the present study, two avidin-like biotin-binding proteins (named streptavidin C1 and C2) from Streptomyces cinnamonensis were newly identified while exploring antifungal proteins against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum. Streptavidin C1 reveals a low correlation (a sequence identity of approximately 64%) with all known streptavidins, whereas streptavidin C2 shares a sequence identity of approximately 94% with other streptavidins. Here, the crystal structures of streptavidin C1 in the mature form and in complex with biotin at 2.1 and 2.5 {\AA} resolution, respectively, were assessed. The overall structures present similar tetrameric features with D2 symmetry to other (strept)avidin structures. Interestingly, the long C-terminal region comprises a short $\alpha$-helix (C-Lid; residues 169–179) and an extension C-terminal peptide (ECP; residues 180–191) which stretches into the biotin-binding sites of the same monomer. This ECP sequence (–180VTSANPPAS188–) is a newly defined biotin-binding site, which reduces the ability to bind to (strept)avidin family proteins. The novel streptavidin C1 could help in the development of an engineered tetrameric streptavidin with reduced biotin-binding capacity as well as other biomaterial tools.},

abstract = {Inorganic phosphate (Pi)–sensing is a key application in many disciplines, and biosensors emerged as powerful analytic tools for use in environmental Pi monitoring, food quality control, basic research, and medical diagnosis. Current sensing techniques exploit either electrochemical or optical detection approaches for Pi quantification. Here, by combining the advantages of a biological Pi–receptor based on the bacterial phosphate binding protein with the principle of thermophoresis, i.e. the diffusional motion of particles in response to a temperature gradient, we developed a continuous, sensitive, and versatile method for detecting and quantifying free Pi in the subnanomolar to micromolar range in sample volumes ≤10 $\mu$L. By recording entropy–driven changes in the directed net diffusional flux of the Pi–sensor in a temperature gradient at defined time intervals, we validate the method for analyzing steady–state enzymatic reactions associated with Pi liberation in real–time for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) turnover by myosin, the actomyosin system and for insoluble, high molecular weight enzyme–protein assemblies in biopsy derived myofibrils. Particular features of the method are: (1) high Pi–sensitivity and selectivity, (2) uncoupling of the read–out signal from potential chemical and spectroscopic interferences, (3) minimal sample volumes and nanogram protein amounts, (4) possibility to run several experiments in parallel, and (5) straightforward data analysis. The present work establishes thermophoresis as powerful sensing method in microscale format for a wide range of applications, augmenting the current set of detection principles in biosensor technology.},

abstract = {Background: The structure of human galectin-16 (Gal-16) has yet to be solved, and its function has remained elusive. Methods: X-ray crystallography was used to determine the atomic structures of Gal-16 and two of its mutants. The Gal-16 oligomer state was investigated by gel filtration, its hemagglutination activity was determined along with its ability to bind lactose using ITC. The cellular distribution of EGFP-tagged Gal-16 in various cell lines was also investigated, and the interaction between Gal-16 and c-Rel was assessed by pull-down studies, microscale thermophoresis and immunofluorescence. Results: Unlike other galectins, Gal-16 lacks the ability to bind the $\beta$-galactoside lactose. Lactose binding could be regained by replacing an arginine (Arg55) with asparagine, as shown in the crystal structures of two lactoseloaded Gal-16 mutants (R55N and R55N/H57R). Gal-16 was also shown to be monomeric by gel filtration, as well as in crystal structures. Thus, this galectin could not induce erythrocyte agglutination. EGFP-tagged Gal-16 was found to be localized mostly in the nucleus of various cell types, and can interact with c-Rel, a member of NF-$\kappa$B family. Conclusions: Gal-16 exists as a monomer and its ligand binding is significantly different from that of other prototype galectins, suggesting that it has a novel function(s). The interaction between Gal-16 and c-Rel indicates that Gal-16 may regulate signal transduction pathways via the c-Rel hub in B or T cells at the maternalfetal interface. General significance: The present study lays the foundation for further studies into the cellular and physiological functions of Gal-16.},

abstract = {Streptomyces mobaraensis produces the papain inhibitor SPI consisting of a 12 kDa protein and small active compounds (SPIac). Purification of the papain inhibitory compounds resulted in four diverse chymostatin derivatives that were characterized by NMR and MS analysis. Chymostatins are hydrophobic tetrapeptide aldehydes from streptomycetes, e.g., S. lavendulae and S. hygroscopicus, that reverse chymosin-mediated angiotensin activation and inhibit other serine and cysteine proteases. Chymotrypsin and papain were both inhibited by the SPIac compounds in the low nanomolar range. SPIac differs from the characterized chymostatins by the exchange of phenylalanine for tyrosine. The crystal structure of one of these chymostatin variants confirmed its molecular structure and revealed a S-configured hemithioacetal bond with the catalytic Cys25 thiolate as well as close interactions with hydrophobic S1 and S2 subsite amino acids. A model for chymostatin biosynthesis is provided based on the discovery of clustered genes encoding several putative nonribosomal peptide synthetases; among them, there is the unusual CstF enzyme that accommodates two canonical amino acid activation domains as well as three peptide carrier protein domains.},

abstract = {Mechanistic studies in DNA repair have focused on roles of multi-protein DNA complexes, so how long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate DNA repair is less well understood. Yet, lncRNA LINP1 is over-expressed in multiple cancers and confers resistance to ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs. Here, we unveil structural and mechanistic insights into LINP1's ability to facilitate nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). We characterized LINP1 structure and flexibility and analyzed interactions with the NHEJ factor Ku70/Ku80 (Ku) and Ku complexes that direct NHEJ. LINP1 self-assembles into phase-separated condensates via RNA–RNA interactions that reorganize to form filamentous Kucontaining aggregates. Structured motifs in LINP1 bind Ku, promoting Ku multimerization and stabilization of the initial synaptic event for NHEJ. Significantly, LINP1 acts as an effective proxy for PAXX. Collective results reveal how lncRNA effectively replaces a DNA repair protein for efficient NHEJ with implications for development of resistance to cancer therapy.},

abstract = {Generation of high-affinity monoclonal antibodies by immunization of chickens is a valuable strategy, particularly for obtaining antibodies directed against epitopes that are conserved in mammals. A generic procedure is established for the humanization of chicken-derived antibodies. To this end, high-affinity binders of the epidermal growth factor receptor extracellular domain are isolated from immunized chickens using yeast surface display. Complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of two high-affinity binders are grafted onto a human acceptor framework. Simultaneously, Vernier zone residues, responsible for spatial CDR arrangement, are partially randomized. A yeast surface display library comprising ≈300 000 variants is screened for high-affinity binders in the scFv and Fab formats. Next-generation sequencing discloses humanized antibody variants with restored affinity and improved protein characteristics compared to the parental chicken antibodies. Furthermore, the sequencing data give new insights into the importance of antibody format, used during the humanization process. Starting from the antibody repertoire of immunized chickens, this work features an effective and fast high-throughput approach for the generation of multiple humanized antibodies with potential therapeutic relevance.},

abstract = {The present study reports a method for transporting high molecular weight collagen for skin regeneration. An independent engineered enzymatic vehicle that has the ability for efficient transdermal delivery of regenerative biomaterial was developed for tissue regeneration. Collagen has been well recognized as a skin regeneration molecule due to its interaction with the extracellular matrix to stimulate skin cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. However, the transdermal delivery of collagen poses a significant challenge due to its high molecular weight as well as a lack of efficient approaches. Here, to improve the transdermal delivery efficiency, $\alpha$-1,4-glycosidic hydrolase was engineered with genetically encoded 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine, which enhanced its biological activity as revealed by microscale thermophoresis. The remodeled catalytic pocket resulted in enhanced substrate binding activity of the enzyme with a predominant glycosaminoglycan (chondroitin sulfate) present in the extracellular matrix of the skin. The engineered enzyme rapidly opened up the skin extracellular matrix fiber (15 min) to ferry collagen across the wall, without disturbing the cellular bundle architecture. Confocal microscopy indicated that macromolecules had diffused three times deeper into the engineered enzyme-treated skin than the native enzyme-treated skin. Gene expression, histopathology, and hematology analysis also supported the penetration of macromolecules. Cytotoxicity (mammalian cell culture) and in vivo (Caenorhabditis elegans and Rattus noryegicus) studies revealed that the congener enzyme could potentially be used as a penetration enhancer, which is of paramount importance for the multimillion cosmetic industries. Hence, it offers promise as a pharmaceutical enzyme for transdermal delivery bioenhancement and dermatological applications.},

abstract = {Abstract: Polysaccharides have been considered as a group of promising candidate for preventing the protein–polyphenol haze formation in beverages. In order to select effective polysaccharides to prevent the haze formation, four protein–polyphenol haze model systems were successfully established using two proteins (i.e., gelatin and bovine serum albumin) and two polyphenols (i.e., procyanidin [PC] and epigallocatechin gallate [EGCG]). Among seven common polysaccharides, 0.5 mg/mL pectin, 0.05 mg/mL xanthan gum, and 0.01 mg/mL guar gum demonstrated the maximum potential for preventing the formation of four protein–polyphenol hazes. Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry confirmed that polysaccharides affected protein–polyphenol interactions. Fluorescence spectrophotometry combined with microscale thermophoresis data indicated the relative affinities of polyphenol to protein and polysaccharide determined the mechanism of polysaccharide for preventing the haze formation. In bovine serum albumin (BSA)/gelatin-EGCG system, polysaccharides (pectin, xanthan gum and guar gum) competed with BSA/gelatin to bind EGCG for prevention the formation of BSA/gelatin-EGCG haze. However, in BSA/gelatin-PC system, polysaccharides (pectin, xanthan gum, and guar gum) formed a ternary complex (protein–tannin–polysaccharide) for increasing the solubility of protein-polyphenol aggregation. From apple juice results, the reduction rates of guar gum in two apple juice systems (gelatin-PC, BSA-PC) were 21% and 56% within 8 weeks, indicating guar gum might be the most effective polysaccharide in preventing the haze formation. Practical Application: This experiment data could be used for development of polysaccharide products for prevention of protein–polyphenol haze formation in beverages.},

abstract = {Polar growth requires the precise tuning of Rho GTPase signalling at distinct plasma membrane domains. The activity of Rho of plant (ROP) GTPases is regulated by the opposing action of guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Whereas plant-specific ROPGEFs have been shown to be embedded in higher-level regulatory mechanisms involving membrane-bound receptor-like kinases, the regulation of GAPs has remained enigmatic. Here, we show that three Arabidopsis ARMADILLO REPEAT ONLY (ARO) proteins are essential for the stabilization of growth sites in root hair cells and trichomes. AROs interact with ROP1 enhancer GAPs (RENGAPs) and bind to the plasma membrane via a conserved polybasic region at the ARO amino terminus. The ectopic spreading of ROP2 in aro2/3/4 mutant root hair cells and the preferential interaction of AROs with active ROPs and anionic phospholipids suggests that AROs recruit RENGAPs into complexes with ROPs to confine ROP signalling to distinct membrane regions.},

Currently, a major limitation in the design of suitable molecular glues and PROTACs is our fragmentary understanding of E3 ligases and their ligand space. We here describe a quantitative assay for the discovery and characterization of E3 ligase ligands that is based on the thermophoretic behavior of a custom reporter ligand. Thereby, it is orthogonal to commonly employed fluorescence-based assays and less affected by the optical properties of test compounds. It can be employed for the high-throughput screening of compound libraries for a given ligase but also for hit validation, which we demonstrate with the identification of unexpected well-binders and non-binders, yielding new insights into the ligand space of cereblon (CRBN).},

PPIs involving short, linear motifs play a major role in immunological recognition, signaling, and regulation and provide attractive starting points for pharmaceutical intervention. Yet, state-of-the-art protein-peptide affinity determination approaches exhibit limited throughput and sensitivity, often resulting from ligand immobilization, labeling, or synthesis. Here, we introduce a high-throughput method for in-solution analysis of protein-peptide interactions using a phenomenon called temperature related intensity change (TRIC). We use TRIC for the identification and fine-mapping of low- and high-affinity protein interaction sites and the definition of sequence binding requirements. Validation is achieved by microarray-based studies using wild-type and mutated recombinant protein and the native protein within tissue lysates. On-chip neutralization and strong correlation with structural data establish TRIC as a quasi-label-free method to determine binding affinities of unmodified peptide libraries with large dynamic range.},

MAGEs assemble with E3 ubiquitin ligases and function as substrate adaptors that direct the ubiquitination of novel targets, including key tumor suppressors. However, how MAGEs recognize their targets is unknown and has impeded the development of MAGE-directed therapeutics. Here, we report the structural basis for substrate recognition by MAGE ubiquitin ligases. Biochemical analysis of the degron motif recognized by MAGE-A11 and the crystal structure of MAGE-A11 bound to the PCF11 substrate uncovered a conserved substrate binding cleft (SBC) in MAGEs. Mutation of the SBC disrupted substrate recognition by MAGEs and blocked MAGE-A11 oncogenic activity. A chemical screen for inhibitors of MAGE-A11:substrate interaction identified 4-Aminoquinolines as potent inhibitors of MAGE-A11 that show selective cytotoxicity. These findings provide important insights into the large family of MAGE ubiquitin ligases and identify approaches for developing cancer-specific therapeutics.},

abstract = {In antibody light chain amyloidosis (AL), mutant light chains (LCs) or their variable domains (VLs) form fibrils, which accumulate in organs and lead to their failure. The molecular mechanism of this disease is still poorly understood. One of the key open issues is whether the mutant VLs and LCs differ in fibril formation. We addressed this question studying the effects of the VL mutations S20N and R61A within the isolated VL domain and in the fulllength LC scaffold. Both VL variants readily form fibrils. Here, we find that in the LC context, the S20N variant is protected from fibril formation while for LC R61A fibril formation is even accelerated compared to VL R61A. Our analyses revealed that the partially unfolded state of the VL R61A domain destabilizes the CL domain by non-native interactions, in turn leading to a further unfolding of the VL domain. In contrast, the folded mutant VL S20N and VL wt form native interactions with CL. These are beneficial for LC stability and promote amyloid resistance. Thus the effects of specific mutations on the VL fold can have opposing effects on LC domain interactions, stability and amyloidogenicity.},

Detergents are poor membrane mimics, and their common use in membrane protein crystallography may be one reason for the challenges in obtaining high-resolution crystal structures of many IMP families. Lipid-like peptides (LLPs) have detergent-like properties and have been proposed as alternatives for the solubilization of G protein-coupled receptors and other membrane proteins. Here, we systematically analyzed the stabilizing effect of LLPs on integral membrane proteins of different families. We found that LLPs could significantly stabilize detergent-solubilized IMPs in vitro. This stabilizing effect depended on the chemical nature of the LLP and the intrinsic stability of a particular IMP in the detergent. Our results suggest that screening a subset of LLPs is sufficient to stabilize a particular IMP, which can have a substantial impact on the crystallization and quality of the crystal.},

abstract = {Dopamine receptors (DRs) are class A G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) prevalent in the central nervous system (CNS). These receptors mediate physiological functions ranging from voluntary movement and reward recognition to hormonal regulation and hypertension. Drugs targeting dopaminergic neurotransmission have been employed to treat several neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and Tourette's syndrome. In vivo, incorporation of GPCRs into lipid membranes is known to be key to their biological function and, by inference, maintenance of their tertiary structure. A further significant challenge in the structural and biochemical characterization of human DRs is their low levels of expression in mammalian cells. Thus, the purification and enrichment of DRs whilst retaining their structural integrity and function is highly desirable for biophysical studies. A promising new approach is the use of styrene–maleic acid (SMA) copolymer to solubilize GPCRs directly in their native environment, to produce polymer-assembled Lipodisqs (LQs). We have developed a novel methodology to yield detergent-free D1-containing Lipodisqs directly from HEK293f cells expressing wild-type human dopamine receptor 1 (D1). We demonstrate that D1 in the Lipodisq retains activity comparable to that in the native environment and report, for the first time, the affinity constant for the interaction of the peptide neurotransmitter neurotensin (NT) with D1, in the native state.},

abstract = {The glycine receptor (GlyR), a member of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel family (pLGIC), displays remarkable variations in the affinity and efficacy of the full agonist glycine and the partial agonist taurine depending on the cell system used. Despite detailed insights in the GlyR three-dimensional structure and activation mechanism, little is known about conformational rearrangements induced by these agonists. Here, we characterized the conformational states of the $\alpha$1 GlyR upon binding of glycine and taurine by microscale thermophoresis expressed in HEK293 cells and Xenopus oocytes after solubilization in amphipathic styrene-maleic acid copolymer nanodiscs. Our results show that glycine and taurine induce different conformational transitions of the GlyR upon ligand binding. In contrast, the variability of agonist affinity is not mediated by an altered conformational change. Thus, our data shed light on specific agonist induced conformational features and mechanisms of pLGIC upon ligand binding determining receptor activation in native environments.},

abstract = {Identification of molecular liabilities and implementation of mitigation strategies are key aspects that need to be considered by pharmaceutical companies developing therapeutic proteins. In the field of monoclonal antibodies, an efficient and streamlined process known as developability assessment is used for the selection of the "fittest" candidate. Other protein modalities, have in most cases only a limited number of possible candidates, requiring a paradigm change to a concept of candidate enabling. The assessment of liabilities at early project phases with the possibility to re-engineer candidates becomes essential for the success of these projects. Each protein possesses a unique stability profile resulting from the interplay of conformational, colloidal, chemical and physical stability attributes. All of these attributes strongly depend on external factors. Conformational and colloidal stability profiles of three non-immunoglobulin domain based proteins, namely Carbonic anhydrase, Ovalbumin and Thyroglobulin, and of two monoclonal antibodies were assessed in dependence of solution pH, ionic strength and varying buffering agents. The impact of screened external factors on proteins' stability attributes varied significantly, indicating presence of molecule specific liabilities. Screening of such a broad space of conditions at early project phases is only feasible using low-material consuming, high-throughput analytical methods as exemplified in this study.},

A total of 2,870 deaths have been reported with a mortality of 3.6%. The mortality of the COVID-19 was nationwide among 79,824 confirmed cases, significantly higher in Hubei Province than that in other regions(4.1% versus 0.84%). Since 1 Feb 2020 the number of discharged cases exceeded the number of the dead. By 29 Feb 2020, the number of discharged patients was 41,625, which exceeded the number of hospitalized patients, and the trend has further increased. The infection of the SARS-COV-2 is spreading and increasing nationwide, and Hubei Province is the main epidemic area, with higher mortality. The outbreak is now under initial control especially in other regions outside of Hubei Province. Due to the different epidemic characteristics between Hubei Province and other regions, we should focus on different prevention and control strategies.},

To investigate which features of Cas9 determine the sensitivity to mismatches along the target DNA, we performed in vitro biochemical assays and bacterial survival assays in Escherichia coli. We demonstrate that arginines in the Cas9 bridge helix influence guide RNA, and target DNA binding and cleavage. They cluster in two groups that either increase or decrease the Cas9 sensitivity to mismatches. We show that the bridge helix is essential for R-loop formation and that R63 and R66 reduce Cas9 specificity by stabilizing the R-loop in the presence of mismatches. Additionally, we identify Q768 that reduces sensitivity of Cas9 to protospacer adjacent motif-distal mismatches. The Cas9_R63A/Q768A variant showed increased specificity in human cells. Our results provide a firm basis for function- and structure-guided mutagenesis to increase Cas9 specificity for genome engineering.},

Several point mutations of GCAP1 have been associated with impaired calcium sensitivity that eventually triggers progressive retinal degeneration. In this work, we demonstrate that the recombinant human protein presents a highly dynamic monomer-dimer equilibrium, whose dissociation constant is influenced by salt concentration and, more importantly, by protein binding to Ca2+ or Mg2+. Based on small-angle X-ray scattering data, protein-protein docking, and molecular dynamics simulations we propose two novel three-dimensional models of Ca2+-bound GCAP1 dimer. The different propensity of human GCAP1 to dimerize suggests structural differences induced by cation binding potentially involved in the regulation of retGC activity.},

Employing comparative structure modeling, site specific crosslinking by single amino acid substitutions with the photoactivatable unnatural amino acid benzoylphenylalanine (BPA) and reconstituted vesicle docking/fusion assays, we mapped the binding interface between Munc18-1 and the neuronal v-SNARE VAMP2 with single amino acid resolution. Our results show that helices 11 and 12 of domain 3a in Munc18-1 interact with the VAMP2 SNARE motif covering the region from layers -4 to +5. Residue Q301 in helix 11 plays a pivotal role in VAMP2 binding and template complex formation. A VAMP2 binding deficient mutant, Munc18-1 Q301D, does not stimulate lipid mixing in a reconstituted fusion assay. The neuronal SNARE-organizer Munc13-1, which also binds VAMP2, does not bypass the requirement for the Munc18-1{\textperiodcentered}VAMP2 interaction. Importantly, Munc18-1 Q301D expression in Munc18-1 deficient neurons severely reduces synaptic transmission, demonstrating the physiological significance of the Munc18-1{\textperiodcentered}VAMP2 interaction.},

We used NMR, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and microscale thermophoresis (MST) methods to investigate the binding of these compounds to tau K18; only one showed unambiguous interaction with tau K18. Several near neighbors of this compound were synthesized and their interactions with tau K18 characterized using additional NMR methods, including 1D ligand-observed NMR, di usion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) and 19F NMR. This study demonstrates that it is possible to detect and characterize IDP–ligand interactions using biophysical methods. However, care must be taken to account for possible artefacts, particularly the impact of compound solubility and where the protein has to be immobilized.},

To understand the molecular function of LAR, structural and biochemical studies of protein fragments derived from the ectodomain of human LAR have been performed. The crystal structure of a fragment encompassing the first four FNIII domains (LARFN1-4) showed a characteristic L shape. SAXS data suggested limited flexibility within LARFN1-4, while rigid-body refinement of the SAXS data using the X-ray-derived atomic model showed a smaller angle between the domains defining the L shape compared with the crystal structure. The capabilities of the individual LAR fragments to interact with heparin was examined using microscale thermophoresis and heparin-affinity chromatography. The results showed that the three N-terminal immunoglobulin domains (LARIg1-3) and the four C-terminal FNIII domains (LARFN5-8) both bound heparin, while LARFN1-4 did not. The low-molecular-weight heparin drug Innohep induced a shift in hydrodynamic volume as assessed by size-exclusion chromatography of LARIg1-3 and LARFN5-8, while the chemically defined pentameric heparin drug Arixtra did not. Together, the presented results suggest the presence of an additional heparin-binding site in human LAR.},

abstract = {UHRF1 is an important epigenetic regulator associated with apoptosis and tumour development. It is a multidomain protein that integrates readout of different histone modification states and DNA methylation with enzymatic histone ubiquitylation activity. Emerging evidence indicates that the chromatinbinding and enzymatic modules of UHRF1 do not act in isolation but interplay in a coordinated and regulated manner. Here, we compared two splicing variants (V1, V2) of murine UHRF1 (mUHRF1) with human UHRF1 (hUHRF1).We showthat insertion of nine amino acids in a linker region connecting the different TTD and PHD histone modification-binding domains causes distinct H3K9me3-binding behaviour of mUHRF1 V1. Structural analysis suggests that in mUHRF1 V1, in contrast to V2 and hUHRF1, the linker is anchored in a surface groove of the TTD domain, resulting in creation of a coupled TTD-PHD module. This establishesmultivalent, synergistic H3- tail binding causing distinct cellular localization and enhanced H3K9me3-nucleosome ubiquitylation activity. In contrast to hUHRF1, H3K9me3-binding of the murine proteins is not allosterically regulated by phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate that interacts with a separate less-conserved polybasic linker region of the protein. Our results highlight the importance of flexible linkers in regulating multidomain chromatin binding proteins and point to divergent evolution of their regulation.},

In plants, the homeodomain (HD) transcription factor WUSCHEL (WUS) is essential for the maintenance of stem cells in the shoot apical meristem. WUS has been reported to bind to diverse DNA motifs and to act as transcriptional activator and repressor. However, the mechanisms underlying this remarkable behavior have remained unclear. Here, we quantitatively delineate WUS binding to three divergent DNA motifs and resolve the relevant structural underpinnings. We show that WUS exhibits a strong binding preference for TGAA repeat sequences, while retaining the ability to weakly bind to TAAT elements. This behavior is attributable to the formation of dimers through interactions of specific residues in the HD that stabilize WUS DNA interaction. Our results provide a mechanistic basis for dissecting WUS dependent regulatory networks in plant stem cell control.},

Here we report a general framework that leverages the computational power of Rosetta for large-scale backbone sampling and energy scoring, followed by side-chain composition, to design heterochiral cyclic peptides that bind to a protein surface of interest. To showcase the applicability of our approach, we identified two peptides (PD-i3 and PD-i6) that target PD-1, a key immune checkpoint, and work as protein ligand decoys. A comprehensive biophysical evaluation confirmed their binding mechanism to PD-1 and their inhibitory effect on the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. Finally, elucidation of their solution structures by NMR served as validation of our de novo design approach. We anticipate that our results will provide a general framework for designing target-specific drug-like peptides.},

In this study, 175,204 ligands obtained from the ZINC15 and OTAVAchemical databases were used for virtual drug screening against HDAC6. Molecular docking studies were performed for 100 selected compounds. Furthermore, the top 10 compounds obtained from docking were tested for their efficacy to inhibit the function of HDAC6. Five compounds (N-(9-oxo-9H-fluoren-3-yl)benzamide, 2-hydroxy-5-[(5-oxo-6-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)amino]benzoic acid, 5-(4-bromonaphthalene-1-sulfonamido)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 2-(naphthalen-2-yl)-N-(1H-1,2,3,4-tetrazol-5-yl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamide, and 4-oxa-5,6 diazapentacyclo[10.7.1.0³,⁷.0⁸,²⁰.0¹⁴,¹⁹]icosa-1,3(7),5,8(20),9,11,14,16,18-nonaen-13-one) inhibited enzymatic activity by more than 50 % compared to DMSO as the control. Two candidates, (N-(9-oxo-9H-fluoren-3-yl)benzamide and 5-(4-bromonaphthalene-1-sulfonamido)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), were identified with considerable cytotoxicity towards drug-sensitive CCRF-CEM and multidrug-resistant CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells. Microscale thermophoresis revealed the binding of N-(9-oxo-9H-fluoren-3-yl)benzamide and 5-(4-bromonaphthalene-1-sulfonamido)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid to purified HDAC6 protein. Both compounds induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner as analyzed by flow cytometry. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that these two compounds bind to HDAC6, inhibit its function, and exert cytotoxic activity by apoptosis induction.},

abstract = {Coformulations containing two therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could offer various benefits like enhanced therapeutic efficacy and better patient compliance. However, there are very few published studies on coformulations and binary mixtures of mAbs. It remains unclear to what extent mAbs with different physicochemical properties can be combined in solution without detrimental effects on protein stability. Here, we present a study including six model mAbs of the IgG1 subclass that are commercially available. In silico and biophysical characterization shows that the proteins have different physicochemical properties. Thus, their combinations represent various scenarios for coformulation development. We prepared all possible binary mixtures of the six mAbs and determined several biophysical parameters that are assessed during early-stage protein drug product development. The measured biophysical parameters are indicative of the conformational protein stability (inflection points of the thermal protein unfolding transitions) and the colloidal protein stability (aggregation onset temperatures and interaction parameter kD from dynamic light scattering). Remarkably, all 15 binary mAb mixtures do not exhibit biophysical parameters that indicate inferior conformational or colloidal stability compared to the least stable mAb in the mixture. Our findings suggest that the coformulation of some therapeutic monoclonal antibodies of the IgG1 subclass could be possible in a straightforward way as severe detrimental effects on the stability of these proteins in binary mixtures were not observed.

abstract = {The recently characterized mammalian writer (methyltransferase) and eraser (demethylase) of the DNA N6-methyladenine (N6mA) methyl mark act on single-stranded (ss) and transiently-unpaired DNA. As YTH domain-containing proteins bind N6mA-containing RNA in mammalian cells, we investigated whether mammalian YTH domains are also methyl mark readers of N6mA DNA. Here, we show that the YTH domain of YTHDC1 (known to localize in the nucleus) binds ssDNA containing N6mA, with a 10 nM dissociation constant. This binding is stronger by a factor of 5 than in an RNA context, tested under the same conditions. However, the YTH domains of YTHDF2 and YTHDF1 (predominantly cytoplasmic) exhibited the opposite effect with ∼1.5–2× stronger binding to ssRNA containing N6mA than to the corresponding DNA. We determined two structures of the YTH domain of YTHDC1 in complex with N6mA-containing ssDNA, which illustrated that YTHDC1 binds the methylated adenine in a single-stranded region flanked by duplexed DNA. We discuss the hypothesis that the writer-reader-eraser of N6mA-containining ssDNA is associated with maintaining genome stability. Structural comparison of YTH and SRA domains (the latter a DNA 5-methylcytosine reader) revealed them to be diverse members of a larger family of DNA/RNA modification readers, apparently having originated from bacterial modification-dependent restriction enzymes.},

abstract = {In the fight against antimicrobial resistance, the bacterial DNA sliding clamp, $\beta$-clamp, is a promising drug target for inhibition of DNA replication and translesion synthesis. The $\beta$-clamp and its eukaryotic homolog, PCNA, share a C-terminal hydrophobic pocket where all the DNA polymerases bind. Here we report that cell penetrating peptides containing the PCNA-interacting motif APIM (APIM-peptides) inhibit bacterial growth at low concentrations in vitro, and in vivo in a bacterial skin infection model in mice. Surface plasmon resonance analysis and computer modeling suggest that APIM bind to the hydrophobic pocket on the $\beta$-clamp, and accordingly, we find that APIM-peptides inhibit bacterial DNA replication. Interestingly, at sub-lethal concentrations, APIM-peptides have anti-mutagenic activities, and this activity is increased after SOS induction. Our results show that although the sequence homology between the $\beta$-clamp and PCNA are modest, the presence of similar polymerase binding pockets in the DNA clamps allows for binding of the eukaryotic binding motif APIM to the bacterial $\beta$-clamp. Importantly, because APIM-peptides display both anti-mutagenic and growth inhibitory properties, they may have clinical potential both in combination with other antibiotics and as single agents.},

abstract = {The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) plays a key role in mammal physiology and in the etiology and progression of inflammatory and oxidative stress-based diseases. In adults, RAGE expression is normally high only in the lung where the protein concentrates in the basal membrane of alveolar Type I epithelial cells. In diseases, RAGE levels increase in the affected tissues and sustain chronic inflammation. RAGE exists as a membrane glycoprotein with an ectodomain, a transmembrane helix and a short carboxyl-terminal tail, or as a soluble ectodomain that acts as a decoy receptor (sRAGE). VC1 domain is responsible for binding to the majority of RAGE ligands including advanced glycation end products (AGEs), S100 proteins and HMGB1. To ascertain whether other ligands exist, we analyzed by MS the material pulled-down by VC1 from human plasma. Twenty out of 295 identified proteins were selected and associated to coagulation and complement processes and to extracellular matrix. Four of them contained a $\gamma$-carboxyl glutamic acid (Gla)-domain, a calcium-binding module, and prothrombin (PT) was the most abundant. Using MicroScale Thermophoresis, we quantified the interaction of PT with VC1 and sRAGE in the absence or presence of calcium that acted as a competitor. PT devoid of the Gla-domain (PT des-Gla) did not bind to sRAGE, providing further evidence that the Gla-domain is critical for the interaction. Finally, the presence of VC1 delayed plasma clotting in a dose-dependent manner. We propose that RAGE is involved in modulating blood coagulation presumably in conditions of lung injury},

Here, we present an alanine scan of A-CooP to investigate the contribution of each amino acid residue to the binding to FABP3 by microscale thermophoresis (MST) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). We also tested the binding affinity of the A-CooP-K, KA-CooP, and retro-inverso A-CooP analogues to the recombinant FABP3. According to the MST analysis, A-CooP showed micromolar (KD = 2.18 µM) affinity to FABP3. Alanine replacement of most of the amino acids did not affect peptide affinity to FABP3. The A-CooP-K variant showed superior binding affinity, while A-[Ala5]CooP and A-[Ala7]CooP, both replacing a glycine residue with alanine, showed negligible binding to FABP3. These results were corroborated in vitro and in vivo using glioblastoma models. Both A-CooP-K and A-CooP showed excellent binding in vitro and homing in vivo, while A-[Ala5]CooP and control peptides failed to bind the cells or home to the intracranial glioblastoma xenografts. These results provide insight into the FABP3–A-CooP interaction that may be important for future applications of drug conjugate design and development.},

We have studied structural transitions and functional stability of a Kunitz trypsin inhibitor from Chickpea (CaTI2), a potent insect gut-protease inhibitor, under different stress conditions like non-neutral pH, elevated temperature and co-solvent concentrations. CaTI2 was cloned and expressed in an eukaryotic system P. pastoris and was investigated for conformational transitions using circular dichroism spectroscopy, differential scanning fluorimetry and activity assay. Native CaTI2 has a sheet dominant structure with 40% $\beta$ sheets and possess a single tryptophan residue situated in the hydrophobic core of the enzyme. The recombinant inhibitor maintained its maximum activity under alkaline pH with its secondary structure intact between pH 6–10. CaTI2 was observed to be thermally stable up to 55 °C with a Tm of 61.3 °C above which the protein unfolds. On treating with chemical denaturant (urea), the CaTI2 lost its inhibitory potential and native conformation beyond 2 M urea concentration. Moreover, the protein unfolded at lower temperatures as the concentration of denaturant increased, suggesting more complex structural changes. Further, the stability of the inhibitor was found to be directly proportional to the solvent polarity. The data, herein offers significant information of inhibitor stability and activity which could be exploited for its further development into an effective pesticide.

Furthermore, NinH shows a preference for a 15 bp signature sequence related to the degenerate consensus favored by Fis. Structural studies reinforced the proposed similarity to Fis and supported the identification of residues involved in DNA binding which were demonstrated experimentally. Overexpression of NinH proved toxic and this correlated with its capacity to associate with DNA. NinH is the first example of a phage-encoded Fis-like NAP that likely influences phage excision-integration reactions or bacterial gene expression.},

Understanding of the G4 folding process is crucial for determining their cellular functions. However, G4-K+ interactions and folding pathways are still not well understood. By using human telomeric G4 (hTG4) as an example, two binding states corresponding to two K+ cations binding to hTG4 were distinguished clearly and fitted precisely. The basic binding parameters during G4-K+ interactions were measured and calculated by taking advantage of microscale thermophoresis (MST), which monitors the changes in charge and size at the same time. The G-hairpin and G-triplex have been suggested as intermediates during G4 folding and unfolding. We further analyzed the equilibrium dissociation constants of 10 possible folding intermediates using MST; thus, the energetically favorable folding/unfolding pathways were proposed. The results might not only shed new light on G4-K+ interactions and G4 folding pathways but also provide an example for experimentally studying DNA-ion interactions.},

abstract = {Thermal shift assays measure the stability of macromolecules and macromolecular assemblies as a function of temperature. The Particle Stability Thermal Release Assay (PaSTRy) of picornaviruses is based on probes becoming strongly fluorescent upon binding to hydrophobic patches of the protein capsid (e.g., SYPRO Orange) or to the viral RNA genome (e.g., SYTO-82) that become exposed upon heating virus particles. PaSTRy has been exploited for studying the stability of viral mutants, viral uncoating, and the effect of capsid-stabilizing compounds. While the results were usually robust, the thermal shift assay with SYPRO Orange is sensitive to surfactants and EDTA and failed at least to correctly report the effect of excipients on an inactivated poliovirus 3 vaccine. Furthermore, interactions between the probe and capsid-binding antivirals as well as mutual competition for binding sites cannot be excluded. To overcome these caveats, we assessed differential scanning fluorimetry with a nanoDSF device as a label-free alternative. NanoDSF monitors the changes in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (ITF) resulting from alterations of the 3D-structure of proteins as a function of the temperature. Using rhinovirus A2 as a model, we demonstrate that nanoDFS is well suited for recording the temperature-dependence of conformational changes associated with viral uncoating with minute amounts of sample. We compare it with orthogonal methods and correlate the increase in viral RNA exposure with PaSTRy measurements. Importantly, nanoDSF correctly identified the thermal stabilization of RV-A2 by pleconaril, a prototypic pocket-binding antiviral compound. NanoDFS is thus a label-free, high throughput-customizable, attractive alternative for the discovery of capsid-binding compounds impacting on viral stability.},

In the present study, saponin microstructures of soyasaponins (soyasaponin Bb, soyasaponin Ab) with lipid components (cholesterol, DPPC (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine)) were designed by the lipid film method. In interaction studies between soyasaponins (soyasaponin Ab/Bb) and Langmuir monolayers (model membranes), composed of cholesterol and DPPC, marked interactions between soyasaponins and a pure cholesterol monolayer were observed. No interaction was detected for soyasaponins with a pure DPPC monolayer. The intercalation of soyasaponins in a mixed DPPC/cholesterol (3:1, w/w) monolayer was only observed for the monodesmosidic soyasaponin Bb whereas the second sugar chain of the bidesmosidic soyasaponin Ab impaired the access to the monolayer. Transmission electron microscopy was used for visualizing particle formation of soyasaponins and lipid components. Pseudo-binary systems (soyasaponin Ab/Bb, cholesterol) formed colloidal associations built up from ring-like subunits in the nanometer size range. In pseudo-ternary systems (soyasaponin, cholesterol, DPPC) soyasaponin Bb attacked the liposomal membrane by forming colloidal associations. Colloidal associations in pseudo-ternary systems with soyasaponin Ab, cholesterol and a phospholipid were only observed in the presence of PE (phosphatidylethanolamine) instead of DPPC. In an MTT assay with a HaCaT cell line (keratinocyte cell line) the cell viability was neither affected by the soyasaponins nor by the corresponding formulations. Both the pure soyasaponin solution and the saponin formulations may be promising adjuvant systems for the intradermal vaccine application. Furthermore, interaction studies between the model antigen ovalbumin and colloidal associations of saponins and cholesterol using MST (Microscale Thermophoresis) gave first indications of an antigen binding to colloidal associations. Ex vivo T-cell proliferation in the presence of soyasaponin Ab was confirmed.},

abstract = {Native-like, soluble, recombinant SOSIP trimers of various designs and based on several env genes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are being tested as immunogens in different animal models. These experiments almost always involve coformulating the trimers with an adjuvant to boost the magnitude of the immune responses. One factor relevant to the choice of an adjuvant is that it should not physically damage the immunogen or impede its ability to present relevant epitopes. As examples, an adjuvant formulation that includes harsh detergents could disrupt the structural integrity of a trimer, and any charged compounds in the formulation could bind to countercharged regions of the trimer and physically occlude nearby epitopes. While a few adjuvants have been tested for their potential effects on SOSIP trimers in vitro, there has been no systematic study. Here, we have assessed how nine different adjuvants of various compositions affect SOSIP trimers of the BG505 and B41 genotypes. We used negative-stain electron microscopy, thermal denaturation, and gel electrophoresis to evaluate effects on trimer integrity and immunoassays to measure effects on the presentation of various epitopes. We conclude that most of the tested adjuvants are benign from these perspectives, but some raise grounds for concern. An acidified alum formulation is highly disruptive to trimer integrity, and a DNA-based polyanionic CpG oligodeoxynucleotide adjuvant binds to trimers and occludes the trimer apex epitope for the PGT145 neutralizing antibody. The methods described here should be generalizable to protein subunit vaccines targeting various pathogens.},

abstract = {The entry of human immunodeficiency virus into host cells is mediated by the envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimeric spike, which consists of three exterior gp120 subunits and three transmembrane gp41 subunits. The trimeric Env undergoes extensive conformational rearrangement upon interaction with the CD4 receptor, transitioning from the unliganded, “closed” State 1 to more-open downstream State 2 and State 3 conformations. Changes in “restraining” amino acid residues, such as leucine 193 and isoleucine 423, destabilize State 1 Env, which then assumes entry-competent, downstream conformations. The introduction of an artificial disulfide bond linking the gp120 and gp41 subunits (SOS) in combination with the I559P (IP) change has allowed structural characterization of soluble gp140 (sgp140) trimers. The conformation of these SOSIP-stabilized sgp140 trimers has been suggested to represent the closed native State 1 conformation. Here we compare the impact on the membrane Env conformation of the SOSIP changes with that of the well-characterized changes (L193R and I423A) that shift Env to downstream States 2 and 3. The results presented here suggest that the SOSIP changes stabilize Env in a conformation that differs from State 1 but also from the downstream Env conformations stabilized by L193R or I423A. IMPORTANCE The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer is triggered by receptor binding to mediate the entry of the virus into cells. Most structural studies of Env trimers have utilized truncated soluble gp140 Envs stabilized with the I559P and SOS changes. Here we present evidence indicating that these stabilizing changes have a profound impact on the conformation of Env, moving Env away from the native pretriggered Env conformation. Our studies underscore the need to acquire structural information on the pretriggered Env conformation, which is recognized by most broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies.},

abstract = {The stem of the influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) is highly conserved and represents an attractive target for a universal influenza vaccine. The 18 HA subtypes of influenza A are phylogenetically divided into two groups, and while protection with group 1 HA stem vaccines has been demonstrated in animal models, studies on group 2 stem vaccines are limited. Thus, we engineered group 2 HA stem-immunogen (SI) vaccines targeting the epitope for the broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody CR9114 and evaluated vaccine efficacy in mice and ferrets. Immunization induced antibodies that bound to recombinant HA protein and viral particles, and competed with CR9114 for binding to the HA stem. Mice vaccinated with H3 and H7-SI were protected from lethal homologous challenge with X-79 (H3N2) or A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9), and displayed moderate heterologous protection. In ferrets, H7-SI vaccination did not significantly reduce weight loss or nasal wash titers after robust 107 TCID50 H7N9 virus challenge. Epitope mapping revealed ferrets developed lower titers of antibodies that bound a narrow range of HA stem epitopes compared to mice, and this likely explains the lower efficacy in ferrets. Collectively, these findings indicate that while group 2 SI vaccines show promise, their immunogenicity and efficacy are reduced in larger outbred species, and will have to be enhanced for successful translation to a universal vaccine.},

abstract = {Attachment of the Influenza A virus onto host cells involves multivalent interactions between virus surface hemagglutinin (HA) and sialoside-containing glyco ligands. Despite the development of extremely powerful multivalent binders of the Influenza virus and other viruses, comparably little is known about the optimal spacing of HA ligands, which ought to bridge binding sites within or across the trimeric HA molecules. To explore the criteria for ligand economical high affinity binding, we systematically probed distance-affinity relationships by means of two differently behaving scaffold types based on (i) flexible polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugates and (ii) rigid self-assembled DNA{\textperiodcentered}PNA complexes. The bivalent scaffolds presented two sialyl-LacNAc ligands in 23-101 {\AA} distance. A combined analysis of binding by means of microscale thermophoresis measurements and statistical mechanics models exposed the inherent limitations of PEG-based spacers. Given the distance requirements of HA, the flexibility of PEG scaffolds is too high to raise the effective concentration of glyco ligands above a value that allows interactions with the low affinity binding site. By contrast, spatial screening with less flexible, self-assembled peptide nucleic acid (PNA){\textperiodcentered}DNA complexes uncovered a well-defined and, surprisingly, bimodal distance-affinity relationship for interactions of the Influenza A virus HA with bivalent displays of the natural sialyl-LacNAc ligand. Optimal constructs conferred 103-fold binding enhancements with only two ligands. We discuss the existence of secondary binding sites and shine light on the preference for intramolecular rather than intermolecular recognition of HA trimers on the virus surface.},

abstract = {The spread of dengue (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) is a major public health concern. The primary target of antibodies that neutralize DENV and ZIKV is the envelope (E) glycoprotein, and there is interest in using soluble recombinant E (sRecE) proteins as subunit vaccines. However, the most potent neutralizing antibodies against DENV and ZIKV recognize epitopes on the virion surface that span two or more E proteins. Therefore, to create effective DENV and ZIKV vaccines, presentation of these quaternary epitopes may be necessary. The sRecE proteins from DENV and ZIKV crystallize as native-like dimers, but studies in solution suggest that these dimers are marginally stable. To better understand the challenges associated with creating stable sRecE dimers, we characterized the thermostability of sRecE proteins from ZIKV and three DENV serotypes, DENV2– 4. All four proteins irreversibly unfolded at moderate temperatures (46 –53 °C). At 23 °C and low micromolar concentrations, DENV2 and ZIKV were primarily dimeric, and DENV3– 4 were primarily monomeric, whereas at 37 °C, all four proteins were predominantly monomeric. We further show that the dissociation constant for DENV2 dimerization is very temperature-sensitive, ranging from <1 M at 25 °C to 50 M at 41 °C, due to a large exothermic enthalpy of binding of 79 kcal/mol. We also found that quaternary epitope antibody binding to DENV2– 4 and ZIKV sRecE is reduced at 37 °C. Our observation of reduced sRecE dimerization at physiological temperature highlights the need for stabilizing the dimer as part of its development as a subunit vaccine.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making the development of effective TB vaccines a global priority. A TB vaccine consisting of a recombinant fusion protein, H4, combined with a novel synthetic cationic adjuvant, IC31{\textregistered}, is currently being developed. The H4 fusion protein consists of two immunogenic mycobacterial antigens, Ag85 B and TB10.4, and the IC31{\textregistered} adjuvant is a mixture of KLK, a leucine-rich peptide (KLKL5KLK), and the oligodeoxynucleotide ODN1a, a TLR9 ligand. However, efficient and robust methods for assessing these formulated components are lacking. Here, we developed and optimized phase analysis light scattering (PALS), electrical sensing zone (ESZ), and Raman, FTIR, and CD spectroscopy methods to characterize the H4-IC31 vaccine formulation. PALS-measured conductivity and zeta potential values could differentiate between the similarly sized particles of IC31{\textregistered} adjuvant and the H4-IC31 vaccine candidate and could thereby serve as a control during vaccine formulation. In addition, zeta potential is indicative of the adjuvant to antigen ratio which is the key in the immunomodulatory response of the vaccine. ESZ was used as an orthogonal method to measure IC31{\textregistered} and H4-IC31 particle sizes. Raman, FTIR, and CD spectroscopy revealed structural changes in H4 protein and IC31{\textregistered} adjuvant, inducing an increase in both the $\beta$-sheet and random coil content as a result of adsorption. Furthermore, nanoDSF showed changes in the tertiary structure of H4 protein as a result of adjuvantation to IC31{\textregistered}. Our findings demonstrate the applicability of biophysical methods to characterize vaccine components in the final H4-IC31 drug product without the requirement for desorption.},

AAV-based gene therapy holds great promise for treating genetic disorders like inherited blindness, muscular atrophy, or bleeding disorders. Multiple naturally occurring and engineered AAV serotypes exist, which differ in capsid sequence and as a consequence in cellular tropism. Individual AAV capsids differ in thermal stability and have a characteristic melting temperature (Tm), which enables serotype-specific discrimination of AAV vectors. Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) combined with a dye-like SYPRO Orange (SO-DSF), which binds to hydrophobic regions of unfolded proteins, has been successfully applied to determine the Tm of AAV capsids. Here, we present DSF measurement of intrinsic fluorescence signal (iDSF) as a simple alternative method for determination of AAV capsid Tm. The study demonstrates that DSF measurement of intrinsic fluorescence signal is a simple, accurate, and rapid alternative to SO-DSF, which enables characterization of AAV capsid stability with excellent precision and without the need of SO or any other dye.},

The resulting reconstituted vehicles termed 'plasmid-chromatin' deliver packaged nucleic acids to and into cells expressing antigens that are recognized by the bsAb, enabling intracellular functionality without detectable cytotoxicity. High efficiency of intracellular nucleic acid delivery is revealed by intracellular expression of plasmid encoded genes in most (∼90%) target cells to which the vehicles were applied under normal growth/medium conditions in nanomolar concentrations. Specific targeting, uptake and transgene expression depends on antibody-mediated cell surface binding: plasmid chromatin of identical composition but with non-targeting bsAbs or without bsAbs is ineffective. Examples that demonstrate applicability, specificity and efficacy of antibody-targeted plasmid chromatin include reporter gene constructs as well as plasmids that enable CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing of target cells.},

S also contains the principal antigenic determinants and is the target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we present the structure of a mouse coronavirus S trimer ectodomain determined at 4.0 {\AA} resolution by single particle cryo-electron microscopy. It reveals the metastable pre-fusion architecture of S and highlights key interactions stabilizing it. The structure shares a common core with paramyxovirus F proteins, implicating mechanistic similarities and an evolutionary connection between these viral fusion proteins. The accessibility of the highly conserved fusion peptide at the periphery of the trimer indicates potential vaccinology strategies to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies against coronaviruses. Finally, comparison with crystal structures of human coronavirus S domains allows rationalization of the molecular basis for species specificity based on the use of spatially contiguous but distinct domains.},

abstract = {During host colonization, bacteria use the alarmones (p)ppGpp to reshape their proteome by acting pleiotropically on DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. Here, we elucidate how the initiating ribosome senses the cellular pool of guanosine nucleotides and regulates the progression towards protein synthesis. Our results show that the affinity of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and the inhibitory concentration of ppGpp for the 30S-bound initiation factor IF2 vary depending on the programmed mRNA. The TufA mRNA enhanced GTP affinity for 30S complexes, resulting in improved ppGpp tolerance and allowing efficient protein synthesis. Conversely, the InfA mRNA allowed ppGpp to compete with GTP for IF2, thus stalling 30S complexes. Structural modeling and biochemical analysis of the TufA mRNA unveiled a structured enhancer of translation initiation (SETI) composed of two consecutive hairpins proximal to the translation initiation region (TIR) that largely account for ppGpp tolerance under physiological concentrations of guanosine nucleotides. Furthermore, our results show that the mechanism enhancing ppGpp tolerance is not restricted to the TufA mRNA, as similar ppGpp tolerance was found for the SETI-containing Rnr mRNA. Finally, we show that IF2 can use pppGpp to promote the formation of 30S initiation complexes (ICs), albeit requiring higher factor concentration and resulting in slower transitions to translation elongation. Altogether, our data unveil a novel regulatory mechanism at the onset of protein synthesis that tolerates physiological concentrations of ppGpp and that bacteria can exploit to modulate their proteome as a function of the nutritional shift happening during stringent response and infection.},

abstract = {Crystallopathies are a heterogeneous group of diseases caused by intrinsic or environmental microparticles or crystals, promoting tissue inflammation and scarring. Certain proteins interfere with crystal formation and growth, e.g., with intrarenal calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystal formation, a common cause of kidney stone disease or nephrocalcinosis-related chronic kidney disease (CKD). We hypothesized that immunoglobulins can modulate CaOx microcrystal formation and crystal growth and that therefore, biological IgG-based drugs designed to specifically target disease modifying proteins would elicit a dual effect on the outcome of CaOx-related crystallopathies. Indeed, both the anti-transforming growth factor (TGF)$\beta$ IgG and control IgG1 antibody impaired CaOx crystallization in vitro, and decreased intrarenal CaOx crystal deposition and subsequent CKD in mice on an oxalate-rich diet compared to oxalate-fed control mice. However, the TGF$\beta$-specific IgG antibody showed nephroprotective effects beyond those of control IgG1 and substantially reduced interstitial fibrosis as indicated by magnetic resonance imaging, silver and a-smooth muscle actin staining, RT-qPCR, and flow cytometry for pro-fibrotic macrophages. Suppressing interstitial fibrosis slowed the decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) compared to treatment with control IgG1 [slope of m = -8.9 vs. m = -14.5 $\mu$l/min/100 g body weight (BW)/day, $\delta$= 38.3%], an increased GFR at the end of the study (120.4 vs. 42.6 $\mu$l/min/100 g BW, $\delta$= 64.6%), and prolonged end stage renal disease (ESRD)-free renal survival by 10 days ($\delta$= 38.5%). Delayed onset of anti-TGF$\beta$ IgG from day 7 was no longer effective. Our results suggest that biological drugs can elicit dual therapeutic effects on intrinsic crystallopathies, such as anti-TGF$\beta$ IgG antibody treatment inhibits CaOx crystallization as well as interstitial fibrosis in nephrocalcinosis-related CKD.},

Here we report the crystal structure of a Fab-A$\beta$ peptide complex that reveals Bapineuzumab surprisingly captures A$\beta$ in a monomeric helical conformation at the N-terminus. Microscale thermophoresis suggests that the Fab binds soluble A$\beta$(1-40) with a K D of 89 (±9) nM. The structure explains the antibody's exquisite selectivity for particular A$\beta$ species and why it cannot recognize N-terminally modified or truncated A$\beta$ peptides.},

abstract = {In cancer cells, the glycoprotein Mucin 1 (MUC1) undergoes abnormal, truncated glycosylation. The truncated glycosylation exposes cryptic peptide epitopes that can be recognized by antibodies. Since these immunogenic regions are cancer specific, they represent ideal targets for therapeutic antibodies. We investigated the role of tumor-specific glycosylation on antigen recognition by the therapeutic antibody AR20.5. We explored the affinity of AR20.5 to a synthetic cancer-specific MUC1 glycopeptide and peptide. The antibody bound to the glycopeptide with an order of magnitude stronger affinity than the naked peptide. Given these results, we postulated that AR20.5 must specifically bind the carbohydrate as well as the peptide. Using X-ray crystallography, we examined this hypothesis by determining the structure of AR20.5 in complex with both peptide and glycopeptide. Surprisingly, the structure revealed that the carbohydrate did not form any specific polar contacts with the antibody. The high affinity of AR20.5 for the glycopeptide and the lack of specific binding contacts support a hypothesis that glycosylation of MUC1 stabilizes an extended bioactive conformation of the peptide recognized by the antibody. Since high affinity binding of AR20.5 to the MUC1 glycopeptide may not driven by specific antibody-antigen contacts, but rather evidence suggests that glycosylation alters the conformational equilibrium of the antigen, which allows the antibody to select the correct conformation. This study suggests a novel mechanism of antibody-antigen interaction and also suggests that glycosylation of MUC1 is important for the generation of high affinity therapeutic antibodies.},

abstract = {Background: Despite progress in cocaine immunotherapy, the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of antibodies which bind to cocaine and its metabolites are not well understood. It is also not clear how the interactions between them differ in a complex matrix such as the serum present in the human body. In the present study, we have used microscale thermophoresis (MST), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) we have evaluated the affinity properties of a representative mouse monoclonal (mAb08) as well as those of polyclonal antibodies purified from vaccinated mouse and human patient serum. Results: MST analysis of fluorescently tagged mAb08 binding to cocaine reveals an approximately 15 fold decrease in its equilibrium dissociation constant in 20-50% human serum compared with that in saline buffer. A similar trend was also found using enriched polyclonal antibodies purified from vaccinated mice and patient serum, for which we have used fluorescently tagged bovine serum albumin conjugated to succinyl norcocaine (BSA-SNC). This conjugate closely mimics both cocaine and the hapten used to raise these antibodies. The ITC data also revealed that cocaine has a moderate affinity of about 2 $\mu$M to 20% human serum and very little interaction with human serum albumin or nonspecific human IgG at that concentration range. In a SPR inhibition experiment, the binding of mAb08 to immobilized BSA-SNC was inhibited by cocaine and benzoylecgonine in a highly competitive manner, whereas the purified polyclonal antibodies from vaccinated humans and mice, revealed preferential selectivity to pharmacologically active cocaine but not to the inactive metabolite benzoylecgonine. We have also developed a simple binding model to simulate the challenges associated with cocaine immunotherapy using the variable quantitative and kinetic properties of the antibodies. Conclusions: High sensitivity calorimetric determination of antibody binding to cocaine and its metabolites provide valuable information for characterization of their interactions and thermodynamic properties. In addition MST measurements of antibody affinity in the presence of biological fluids will provide a better opportunity to make reliable decisions and facilitate the design of cocaine vaccines and immunization conditions. The methods should be more widely adopted in characterization of antibody complexes.},

abstract = {Recombinant antibodies and their derivatives are receiving ever increasing attention for many applications. Nevertheless, they differ widely in biophysical properties, from stable monomers to metastable aggregation-prone mixtures of oligomers. Previous work from our laboratory presented the combination of structure-based analysis with family consensus alignments as being able to improve the properties of immunoglobulin variable domains. We had identified a series of mutations in the variable domains that greatly influenced both the stability and the expression level of single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments produced in the periplasm of Escherichia coli. We now investigated whether these effects are transferable to Fab fragments and immunoglobulin G (IgG) produced in bacteria, Pichia pastoris, and mammalian cells. Taken together, our data indicate that engineered mutations can increase functional expression levels only for periplasmic expression in prokaryotes. In contrast, stability against thermal and denaturant-induced unfolding is improved by the same mutations in all formats tested, including scFv, Fab and IgG, independent of the expression system. The mutations in VH also influenced the structural homogeneity of full-length IgG, and the reducibility of the distant CH1CL inter-chain disulfide bond. These results confirm the potential of structure-based protein engineering in the context of full-length IgGs and the transferability of stability improvements discovered with smaller antibody fragments. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author.},

In this study, we present a sample-efficient, free-solution method, termed microscale thermophoresis, that is capable of analysing interactions of proteins or small molecules in biological liquids such as blood serum or cell lysate. The technique is based on the thermophoresis of molecules, which provides information about molecule size, charge and hydration shell. We validated the method using immunologically relevant systems including human interferon gamma and the interaction of calmodulin with calcium. The affinity of the small-molecule inhibitor quercetin to its kinase PKA was determined in buffer and human serum, revealing a 400-fold reduced affinity in serum. This information about the influence of the biological matrix may allow to make more reliable conclusions on protein functionality, and may facilitate more efficient drug development. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Human IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies (Abs) can mediate Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and engineering of the Ab Fc (point mutation; defucosylation) has been shown to affect ADCC by modulating affinity for FcR$\gamma$IIIa. In the absence of a CH1 domain, many camelid heavy-chain Abs (HCAbs) naturally bear very long and flexible hinge regions connecting their VHH and CH2 domains. To better understand the influence of hinge length and structure on HCAb ADCC, we produced a series of hinge-engineered epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-specific chimeric camelid VHH-human Fc Abs and characterized their affinities for recombinant EGFR and FcR$\gamma$IIIa, their binding to EGFR-positive tumor cells, and their ability to elicit ADCC. In the case of one chimeric HCAb (EG2-hFc), we found that variants bearing longer hinges (IgG3 or camelid hinge regions) showed dramatically improved ADCC in comparison with a variant bearing the human IgG1 hinge, in similar fashion to a variant with reduced CH2 fucosylation. Conversely, an EG2-hFc variant bearing a truncated human IgG1 upper hinge region failed to elicit ADCC. However, there was no consistent association between hinge length and ADCC for four similarly engineered chimeric HCAbs directed against distinct EGFR epitopes. These findings demonstrate that the ADCC of some HCAbs can be modulated simply by varying the length of the Ab hinge. Although this effect appears to be heavily epitope-dependent, this strategy may be useful to consider during the design of VHH-based therapeutic Abs for cancer.},

These methods are based on high specificity, easy reversibility and biological interactions between two molecules (e.g., between receptor and ligand or antibody and antigen). However, no simple techniques have yet been described to characterize and purify subclasses of immunoglobulins (Ig) from some animals of biotechnology importance such as equines, which are frequently used to produce biotherapeutic antibodies. The sera of these animals present a large number of Ig classes that have a greater complexity than other animals. The implementation of an effective protocol to purify the desired antibody class/subclasses requires meticulous planning to achieve yields at a high purity. The IgG3 subclass of equine-Ig has recently been used as antigen in a new diagnostic test for allergic responses to horse sera-based therapies.

In celiac disease, transglutaminase 2-modified (TG2-modified; deamidated) gluten peptides drive disease-specific T cell and B cell responses, and antibodies to deamidated gluten peptides are excellent diagnostic markers. Here, we substantiate by high-throughput sequencing of IGHV genes that antibodies to a disease-specific, deamidated, and immunodominant B cell epitope of gluten (PLQPEQPFP) have biased and stereotyped usage of IGHV3-23 and IGHV3-15 gene segments with modest somatic mutations. X-ray crystal structures of 2 prototype IGHV3-15/IGKV4-1 and IGHV3-23/IGLV4-69 antibodies reveal peptide interaction mainly via germline-encoded residues. In-depth mutational analysis showed restricted selection and substitution patterns at positions involved in antigen binding. While the IGHV3-15/IGKV4-1 antibody interacts with Glu5 and Gln6, the IGHV3-23/IGLV4-69 antibody interacts with Gln3, Pro4, Pro7, and Phe8 - residues involved in substrate recognition by TG2. Hence, both antibodies, despite different interaction with the epitope, recognize signatures of TG2 processing that facilitates B cell presentation of deamidated gluten peptides to T cells, thereby providing a molecular framework for the generation of these clinically important antibodies. The study provides essential insight into the pathogenic mechanism of celiac disease.},

Here, the degradation of proteins was detected by competition with standard substrates of proteases and is shown as the relative residue rate. Four protein drugs were subjected to this method, and the results suggested that growth hormone was degraded by aminopeptidase N and kallikrein-related peptidase 5, pertuzumab was hardly degraded by the proteases, factor VII was degraded by carboxypeptidase B, neprilysin, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and peptidyl dipeptidase A, and fibrinogen was degraded by carboxypeptidase B and kallikrein-related peptidase 5, findings consistent with the literature. The results were confirmed by microscale thermophoresis; additionally, activity detection in vitro substantiated that the degradation of factor VII decreased its activity. We demonstrate that this method can be used to identify key proteases of proteins with high accuracy, precision and durability.},

abstract = {Aggregation is a common challenge in the optimization of therapeutic antibody formulations. Since initial self-association of two monomers is typically a reversible process, the aim of this study is to identify different excipients that are able to shift this equilibrium to the monomeric state. The hypothesis is that a specific interaction between excipient and antibody may hinder two monomers from approaching each other, based on previous work in which dexamethasone phosphate showed the ability to partially reverse formed aggregates of the monoclonal IgG1 antibody bevacizumab back into monomers. The current study focuses on the selection of therapeutically inactive compounds with similar properties. Adenosine monophosphate, adenosine triphosphate, sucrose-6-phosphate and guanosine monophosphate were selected in silico through similarity searching and docking. All four compounds were predicted to bind to a protein-protein interaction hotspot on the Fc region of bevacizumab and thereby breaking dimer formation. The predictions were supported in vitro: An interaction between AMP and bevacizumab with a dissociation constant of 9.59 ± 0.15 mM was observed by microscale thermophoresis. The stability of the antibody at elevated temperature (40 C) in a 51 mM phosphate buffer pH 7 was investigated in presence and absence of the excipients. Quantification of the different aggregation species by asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation and size exclusion chromatography demonstrates that all four excipients are able to partially overcome the initial self-association of bevacizumab monomers.},

abstract = {Human cystatin C (hCC), like many other amyloidogenic proteins, dimerizes and possibly makes aggregates by subdomain swapping. Inhibition of the process should suppress the fibrillogenesis leading to a specific amyloidosis (hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy, HCCAA). It has been reported that exogenous agents like monoclonal antibodies against cystatin C are able to suppress formation of cystatin C dimers and presumably control the neurodegenerative disease. We have studied in detail two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) representing very different aggregation inhibitory potency, Cyst10 and Cyst28, to find binding sites in hCC sequence responsible for the immunocomplex formation and pave the way for possible immunotherapy of HCCAA. We used the epitope extraction/excision mass spectrometry approach with the use of different enzymes complemented by affinity studies with synthetic hCC fragments as a basic technique for epitope identification. The results were analyzed in the context of hCC structure allowing us to discuss the binding sites for both antibodies. Epitopic sequences for clone Cyst28 which is a highly potent dimerization inhibitor were found in N-terminus, loop 1 and 2 (L1, L2) and fragments of $\beta$2 and $\beta$3 strands. The crucial difference between conformational epitope sequences found for both mAbs seems to be the lack of interactions with hCC via N-terminus and the loop 1 in the case of mAb Cyst10. Presumably the interactions of mAbs with hCC via L1 and $\beta$ sheet fragments make the hCC structure rigid and unable to undergo the swapping process.},

abstract = {Mesothelin is an epithelial marker highly expressed at the cell surface of cancer cells from diverse origins, including ovarian and pancreatic adenocarcinomas and mesotheliomas. Previously, we identified and characterized an antimesothelin nanobody (NbG3a) for in vitro diagnostic applications. The main goal of this research was to establish the potential of NbG3a as a molecular imaging agent. Site-specific biotinylated NbG3a (bNbG3a) was bound to streptavidin-conjugated reagents for in vitro and in vivo assays. Initially, we performed microscale thermophoresis to determine the binding affinity between bNbG3a and human (K d = 46 ± 8 nM) or mouse (K d = 4.8 ± 0.4 nM) mesothelin protein. The human and mouse cross-reactivity was confirmed by in vivo optical imaging using bNbG3a bound to fluorescent streptavidin. We also localized the binding site of nNbG3a on human mesothelin using overlapping peptide scan. NbG3a recognized an epitope within residues 21-65 of the mature membrane bound form of human mesothelin, which is part of the N-terminal region of mesothelin that is important for interactions between mesothelin on peritoneal cells and CA125 on tumor cells. Next, the bNbG3a in vivo half-life after intravenous injection in healthy mice was estimated by ELISA assay to be 5.3 ± 1.3 min. In tumor-bearing animals, fluorescent bNbG3a accumulated in a subcutaneous ovarian xenograft (A1847) and in two syngeneic, orthotopic ovarian tumors (intraovary and intraperitoneal ID8) within an hour of intravenous injection that peaked by 4 h and persisted up to 48 h. MRI analysis of bNbG3a-targeted streptavidin-labeled iron oxides showed that the MRI signal intensity decreased 1 h after injection for a subcutaneous xenograft model of ovarian cancer for bNbG3a-labeled iron oxides compared to unlabeled iron oxides. The signal intensity differences continued up to the final time point at 24 h post injection. Finally, in vivo immunofluorescence 24 or 48 h after bNbG3a intravenous injection showed bNbG3a diffuse distribution of both xenograft and syngeneic ovarian tumors, with local areas of high concentration throughout A1847 human tumor. The data support the use of NbG3a for continued preclinical development and translation to human applications for cancers that overexpress mesothelin.},

We describe the first crystal structure of a cytokine-directed human IgG1$\lambda$ autoantibody-binding fragment (Fab) at 1.9 {\AA} (1 {\AA} = 0.1 nm) resolution. Its CDR3-H substantially differs from all VH7 germline IgG1 structures reported previously. We derive a reliable model of the antigen-autoantibody complex by using NMR chemical shift perturbation data in combination with computational methods. Superposition of the modelled complex structure with the human GM-CSF-GM-CSF ternary receptor complex reveals only little overlap between receptor and Fab when bound to GM-CSF.

abstract = {A supramolecular strategy is presented for the assembly of growth factors employing His6-tagged single-domain antibodies (VHH). A combination of orthogonal supramolecular interactions of $\beta$-cyclodextrin ($\beta$CD)-adamantyl (Ad) host-guest and N-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-histidine (His) interactions was employed to generate reversible and homogeneous layers of growth factors. A single-domain antibody VHH fragment was identified to bind to the human bone morphogenetic protein-6 (hBMP6) growth factor and could be recombinantly expressed in E. coli. The VHH fragment was equipped with a C-terminal hexahistidine (His6) tether to facilitate the assembly on $\beta$CD surfaces using a linker that contains an Ad group to bind to the $\beta$CD receptors and an NTA moiety to interact with the His6-tag upon cocomplexation of Ni2+ ions. After exploring the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the VHH assemblies on $\beta$CD surfaces using a variety of experimental techniques including microcontact printing ($\mu$CP), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), microscale thermophoresis (MST), and theoretical models for determining the thermodynamic behavior of the system, hBMP6 was assembled onto the VHH-functionalized surfaces. After analyzing the immobilized hBMP6 using immunostaining, the biological activity of hBMP6 was demonstrated in cell differentiation experiments. Early osteogenic differentiation was analyzed in terms of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of KS483-4C3 mouse progenitor cells, and the results indicated that the reversibly immobilized growth factors were functionally delivered to the cells. In conclusion, the supramolecular strategy used here offers the necessary affinity, reversibility, and temporal control to promote biological function of the growth factors that were delivered by this strategy.},

abstract = {In the root endophyte Serendipita indica, several lectin-like members of the expanded multigene family of WSC proteins are transcriptionally induced in planta and are potentially involved in $\beta$-glucan remodeling at the fungal cell wall. Using biochemical and cytological approaches we show that one of these lectins, SiWSC3 with three WSC domains, is an integral fungal cell wall component that binds to long-chain $\beta$1-3-glucan but has no affinity for shorter $\beta$1-3- or $\beta$1-6-linked glucose oligomers. Comparative analysis with the previously identified $\beta$-glucan-binding lectin SiFGB1 demonstrated that whereas SiWSC3 does not require $\beta$1-6-linked glucose for efficient binding to branched $\beta$1-3-glucan, SiFGB1 does. In contrast to SiFGB1, the multivalent SiWSC3 lectin can efficiently agglutinate fungal cells and is additionally induced during fungus–fungus confrontation, suggesting different functions for these two $\beta$-glucan-binding lectins. Our results highlight the importance of the $\beta$-glucan cell wall component in plant–fungus interactions and the potential of $\beta$-glucan-binding lectins as specific detection tools for fungi in vivo.},

abstract = {Changes in glycosylation are salient features of cancer cells. Here, we report on the diagnostic and therapeutic properties of IDK1, an antibody against tumour associated, hypoglycosylated bone sialoprotein (hypo-BSP). The affinity of the rat monoclonal antibody IDK1 for hypo-BSP, as determined by microscale thermophoresis, was three orders of magnitude higher than for mature BSP, whereas the mouse monoclonal antibody used had similar affinity for both BSP forms. IDK1 showed no activity against the proliferation or migration of normal or cancer cells growing in vitro. In vivo, however, IDK1 caused dose-dependent regression of soft tissue and skeletal lesions in nude rats harbouring human MDA-MB-231 cells. At optimal dose, 80% of the treated rats showed complete remission of all tumour lesions. Analysis of BSP expression in vitro by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and immunocytochemistry showed basal levels of this protein, which were visible only in a fraction of these cells. Cells of the metastatic cell lines MDA-MB-231 and PC-3 were more often positive for hypo-BSP. In addition, there was co-expression of both forms in some cells, but almost no co-localization; rather, hypo-BSP was present in the nucleus, and mature BSP was detected extra-cellularly. Normal osteoblasts and osteoclasts were negative for hypo-BSP. Breast cancer tissue, however, showed strong expression of mature BSP, which was present intra-cellularly as well as in vesicles outside cells. Hypo-BSP was present mainly in lesions from skeletal sites, thus explaining the antineoplastic activity of IDK1, which was high in lesions growing in the vicinity of the skeleton but low in lesions growing subcutaneously. Finally, hypo-BSP was detected in specimens from breast cancer patients, with a significantly greater intensity in skeletal metastases as compared to the respective primary cancers. In conclusion, IDK-1 is an antibody with diagnostic and therapeutic applications in skeletal metastases of breast cancer.},

abstract = {Small molecules not only represent cellular building blocks and metabolic intermediates, but also regulatory ligands and signaling molecules that interact with proteins. Although these interactions affect cellular metabolism, growth, and development, they have been largely understudied. Herein, we describe a method, which we named PROtein-Metabolite Interactions using Size separation (PROMIS), that allows simultaneous, global analysis of endogenous protein-small molecule and of protein-protein complexes. To this end, a cell-free native lysate from Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography, followed by quantitative metabolomic and proteomic analyses. Proteins and small molecules showing similar elution behavior, across protein-containing fractions, constituted putative interactors. Applying PROMIS to an A. thaliana extract, we ascertained known protein-protein (PPIs) and protein-metabolite (PMIs) interactions and reproduced binding between small-molecule protease inhibitors and their respective proteases. More importantly, we present examples of two experimental strategies that exploit the PROMIS dataset to identify novel PMIs. By looking for similar elution behavior of metabolites and enzymes belonging to the same biochemical pathways, we identified putative feedback and feed-forward regulations in pantothenate biosynthesis and the methionine salvage cycle, respectively. By combining PROMIS with an orthogonal affinity purification approach, we identified an interaction between the dipeptide Tyr-Asp and the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. In summary, we present proof of concept for a powerful experimental tool that enables system-wide analysis of PMIs and PPIs across all biological systems. The dataset obtained here comprises nearly 140 metabolites and 5000 proteins, which can be mined for putative interactors.},

abstract = {Signal perception and transmission of the plant hormone ethylene are mediated by a family of receptor histidine kinases located at the Golgi-ER network. Similar to bacterial and other plant receptor kinases, these receptors work as dimers or higher molecular weight oligomers at the membrane. Sequence analysis and functional studies of different isoforms suggest that the ethylene receptor family is classified into two subfamilies. In Arabidopsis, the type-I subfamily has two members (ETR1 and ERS1) and the type-II subfamily has three members (ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4). Whereas subfamily-I of the Arabidopsis receptors and their interactions with downstream elements in the ethylene pathway has been extensively studied in the past; related information on subfamily-II is sparse. In order to dissect the role of type-II receptors in the ethylene pathway and to decode processes associated with this receptor subfamily on a quantitative molecular level, we have applied biochemical and spectroscopic studies on purified recombinant receptors and downstream elements of the ethylene pathway. To this end, we have expressed purified ETR2 as a prototype of the type-II subfamily, ETR1 for the type-I subfamily and downstream ethylene pathway proteins CTR1 and EIN2. Functional folding of the purified receptors was demonstrated by CD spectroscopy and autokinase assays. Quantitative analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) by microscale thermophoresis (MST) revealed that ETR2 has similar affinities for CTR1 and EIN2 as previously reported for the subfamily-I prototype ETR1 suggesting similar roles in PPI-mediated signal transfer for both subfamilies. We also used in planta fluorescence studies on transiently expressed proteins in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells to analyze homo- and heteromer formation of receptors. These studies show that type-II receptors as well as the type-I receptors form homo- and heteromeric complexes at these conditions. Notably, type-II receptor homomers and type-II:type-I heteromers are more stable than type-I homomers as indicated by their lower dissociation constants obtained in microscale thermophoresis studies. The enhanced stability of type-II complexes emphasizes the important role of type-II receptors in the ethylene pathway.},

abstract = {Interactions between metabolites and proteins play an integral role in all cellular functions. Here we describe an affinity purification (AP) approach in combination with LC/MS-based metabolomics and proteomics that allows, to our knowledge for the first time, analysis of protein–metabolite and protein–protein interactions simultaneously in plant systems. More specifically, we examined protein and small-molecule partners of the three (of five) nucleoside diphosphate kinases present in the Arabidopsis genome (NDPK1–NDPK3). The bona fide role of NDPKs is the exchange of terminal phosphate groups between nucleoside diphosphates (NDPs) and triphosphates (NTPs). However, other functions have been reported, which probably depend on both the proteins and small molecules specifically interacting with the NDPK. Using our approach we identified 23, 17, and 8 novel protein partners of NDPK1, NDPK2, and NDPK3, respectively, with nucleotide-dependent proteins such as actin and adenosine kinase 2 being enriched. Particularly interesting, however, was the co-elution of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and reduced glutathione (GSH) with the affinity-purified NDPK1 complexes. Following up on this finding, we could demonstrate that NDPK1 undergoes glutathionylation, opening a new paradigm of NDPK regulation in plants. The described results extend our knowledge of NDPKs, the key enzymes regulating NDP/NTP homeostasis.},

abstract = {Two-pore channels (TPCs) constitute a family of intracellular cation channels with diverse permeation properties and functions in animals and plants. In the model plant Arabidopsis, the vacuolar cation channel TPC1 is involved in propagation of calcium waves and in cation homeostasis. Here, we discovered that the dimerization of a predicted helix within the carboxyl-terminus (CTH) is essential for the activity of TPC1. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated the interaction of the two C-termini and pointed towards the involvement of the CTH in this process. Synthetic CTH peptides dimerized with a dissociation constant of 3.9 µM. Disruption of this domain in TPC1 either by deletion or point mutations impeded the dimerization and cation transport. The homo-dimerization of the CTH was analyzed in silico using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the study of aggregation, followed by atomistic MD simulations. The simulations revealed that the helical region of the wild type, but not a mutated CTH forms a highly stable, antiparallel dimer with characteristics of a coiled-coil. We propose that the voltage- and Ca(2+)-sensitive conformation of TPC1 depends on C-terminal dimerization, adding an additional layer to the complex regulation of two-pore cation channels.},

abstract = {14-3-3 proteins play an important role in the regulation of many cellular processes. The Arabidopsis vacuolar two-pore K(+) channel 1 (TPK1) interacts with the 14-3-3 protein GRF6 (GF14-$\lambda$). Upon phosphorylation of the putative binding motif in the N-terminus of TPK1, GRF6 binds to TPK1 and activates the potassium channel. In order to gain a deeper understanding of this 14-3-3-mediated signal transduction, we set out to identify the respective kinases, which regulate the phosphorylation status of the 14-3-3 binding motif in TPK1. Here, we report that the calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) can phosphorylate and thereby activate the 14-3-3 binding motif in TPK1. Focusing on the stress-activated kinase CPK3, we visualized direct and specific interaction of TPK1 with the kinase at the tonoplast in vivo. In line with its proposed role in K(+) homeostasis, TPK1 phosphorylation was found to be induced by salt stress in planta, and both cpk3 and tpk1 mutants displayed salt-sensitive phenotypes. Molecular modeling of the TPK1-CPK3 interaction domain provided mechanistic insights into TPK1 stress-regulated phosphorylation responses and pinpointed two arginine residues in the N-terminal 14-3-3 binding motif in TPK1 critical for kinase interaction. Taken together, our studies provide evidence for an essential role of the vacuolar potassium channel TPK1 in salt-stress adaptation as a target of calcium-regulated stress signaling pathways involving Ca(2+), Ca(2+)-dependent kinases, and 14-3-3 proteins.},

Calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs), which upon Ca(2+) binding activate CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) regulate a multitude of physiological processes in plants. Here, we combine phylogenomics and functional analyses to investigate the occurrence and structural conservation of CBL and CIPK proteins in 26 species representing all major clades of eukaryotes. We demonstrate the presence of at least singular CBL-CIPK pairs in representatives of Archaeplastida, Chromalveolates and Excavates and their general absence in Opisthokonta and Amoebozoa. This denotes CBL-CIPK complexes as evolutionary ancient Ca(2+) signaling modules that likely evolved in the ancestor of all Bikonta. Furthermore, we functionally characterize the CBLs and CIPK from the parabasalid human pathogen Trichomonas vaginalis. Our results reveal strict evolutionary conservation of functionally important structural features, preservation of biochemical properties and a remarkable cross-kingdom protein-protein interaction potential between CBLs and CIPKs from Arabidopsis thaliana and T. vaginalis. Together our findings suggest an ancient evolutionary origin of a functional CBL-CIPK signaling module close to the root of eukaryotic evolution and provide insights into the initial evolution of signaling networks and Ca(2+) signaling specificity.},

Recent advances have clarified the molecular framework of gametophytic pollen tube guidance. Multiple species-specific attractant peptides are secreted from synergid cells, the proper development and function of which are regulated by female gametes. Multiple receptor-like kinases on the pollen tube tip are involved in sensing species-specific attractant peptides. In this Update article, recent progress in our understanding of the mechanism of gametophytic pollen tube guidance is reviewed, including attraction by synergid cells, control of pollen tube guidance by female gametes, and directional growth of the pollen tube by directional cue sensing. Future directions in the study of pollen tube guidance also are discussed.},

The protein shows an apparent mass of 21 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing condition. OPI exhibits inhibitory activity against trypsin. Analysis of the far-UV circular dichroism spectrum showed that the protein contains approx. 39% beta-sheets but only approx. 5% alpha-helices. The protein is thermally quite stable, and exhibits a cooperative thermal unfolding transition at approx. 70 degree C, as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy and differential scanning fluorimetry. De novo sequencing of OPI by nanoESI-Q-ToF mass spectrometry (MS) allowed the assignment of about 83% of its primary structure, which indicated that the protein shares 43% sequence identity with a putative 21 kDa trypsin inhibitor from Theobroma bicolor. An intramolecular disulfide linkage between Cys149 and Cys156 was also detected. The protein showed approx 24 and approx 25% sequence identity with alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor from barley and soybean (Kunitz) trypsin inhibitor, respectively. Comparative structure modeling of OPI revealed a structural fold similar to other Kunitz-type TIs. The presence of Cys149-Cys156 disulfide bond as detected by MS and a second disulfide bond connecting Cys44-Cys91, conserved in all Kunitz-type TIs, is also identified in the model.},

In this context, plant cells can sense the perturbation of their walls and trigger adaptive modifications in cell wall polymer interactions. Catharanthus roseus receptor-like kinase 1-like (CrRLK1L) THESEUS1 (THE1) was previously shown in Arabidopsis to trigger growth inhibition and defense responses upon perturbation of the cell wall, but so far, neither the ligand nor the role of the receptor in normal development was known. Here, we report that THE1 is a receptor for the peptide rapid alkalinization factor (RALF) 34 and that this signaling module has a role in the fine-tuning of lateral root initiation. We also show that RALF34-THE1 signaling depends, at least for some responses, on FERONIA (FER), another RALF receptor involved in a variety of processes, including immune signaling, mechanosensing, and reproduction [1]. Together, the results show that RALF34 and THE1 are part of a signaling network that integrates information on the integrity of the cell wall with the coordination of normal morphogenesis.},

abstract = {Background: The recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns during infection is central to the mounting of an effective immune response. In spite of their importance, it remains difficult to identify these molecules and the host receptors required for their perception, ultimately limiting our understanding of the role of these molecules in the evolution of host-pathogen relationships. Results: We employ a comparative genomics screen to identify six new immune eliciting peptides from the phytopathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. We then perform a reverse genetic screen to identify Arabidopsis thaliana leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases required for the recognition of these elicitors. We test the six elicitors on 187 receptor-like kinase knock-down insertion lines using a high-throughput peroxidase-based immune assay and identify multiple lines that show decreased immune responses to specific peptides. From this primary screen data, we focused on the interaction between the xup25 peptide from a bacterial xanthine/uracil permease and the Arabidopsis receptor-like kinase xanthine/uracil permease sensing 1; a family XII protein closely related to two well-characterized receptor-like kinases. We show that xup25 treatment increases pathogenesis-related gene induction, callose deposition, seedling growth inhibition, and resistance to virulent bacteria, all in a xanthine/uracil permease sensing 1-dependent manner. Finally, we show that this kinase-like receptor can bind the xup25 peptide directly. These results identify xup25 as a P. syringae microbe-associated molecular pattern and xanthine/uracil permease sensing 1 as a receptor-like kinase that detects the xup25 epitope to activate immune responses. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates an efficient method to identify immune elicitors and the plant receptors responsible for their perception. Further exploration of these molecules will increase our understanding of plant-pathogen interactions and the basis for host specificity.},

Several XA21 binding proteins have been characterized, however the early events governing XA21 signaling have not been fully elucidated. Results: Here we report the identification of one LRR-RLK gene (XIK1) whose expression is induced rapidly upon the infection with the pathogen of Xoo. Expression pattern analysis reveals that XIK1 is preferentially expressed in reproductive leaves and panicles, and that expression is associated with plant development. By using RNA interference (RNAi), we silenced the expression of XIK1 in rice with Xa21 and found that reduced expression of XIK1 compromised disease resistance mediated by XA21. In addition, we found that the expression of the downstream marker genes of pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) triggered immunity (PTI) in rice was compromised in Xa21 plants silenced for XIK1. Conclusion: Our study reveals that the LRR-RLK gene XIK1 is Xoo-responsive and positively regulates Xa21-mediated disease resistance.},

Herein, we identified and functionally characterized CaHsfB2a, a nuclear-localized heat shock factor involved in pepper immunity to R. solanacearum inoculation (RSI) and tolerance to HTHH. CaHsfB2a is transcriptionally induced in pepper plants by RSI or HTHH and by exogenous application of salicylic acid (SA), methyl jasmonate (MeJA), ethylene (ETH), or abscisic acid (ABA). Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of CaHsfB2a significantly impaired pepper immunity to RSI, hampered HTHH tolerance, and curtailed expression of immunity- and thermotolerance-associated marker genes such as CaHIR1, CaNPR1, CaABR1, and CaHSP24. Likewise, transient overexpression of CaHsfB2a in pepper leaves induced hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death and H2O2 accumulation and upregulated the above-mentioned marker genes as well as CaWRKY6 and CaWRKY40. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and microscale thermophoresis (MST) analysis revealed that CaHsfB2a bound the promoters of both CaWRKY6 and CaWRKY40. In a parallel experiment, we determined by ChIP-PCR and MST that CaHsfB2a was regulated directly by CaWRKY40 but indirectly by CaWRKY6. Cumulatively, our results suggest that CaHsfB2a positively regulates plant immunity against RSI and tolerance to HTHH, via transcriptional cascades and positive feedback loops involving CaWRKY6 and CaWRKY40.},

abstract = {Purpose: CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T therapy has shown impactful results in treatment of B-cell malignancies. However, immune recognition of the murine scFv may render subsequent infusion(s) ineffective. Also, nonselective expansion of both CAR-transduced and nontransduced T cells during the production stage affects the yield and purity of final products. Here, we aim to develop a humanized selective (hs) CD19 CAR to solve the above problems. Experimental Design: A CD19 hsCAR was designed, which incorporated a short selective domain between the humanized heavy chain and light chain. The CAR was examined for its property, and then trialed in 5 highly treated B-ALL patients. Results: hsCAR possessed around 6-fold higher affinity to CD19 versus murine CAR (mCAR). Incubation with selective domain-specific mAbs (SmAb) selectively expanded CARtransduced T cells, and led to a higher proportion of central memory T cells in the final products. SmAb-stimulated CD19 hsCAR-T cells exhibited superior antitumor cytotoxic functions in vitro and in vivo. Autologous (n = 2) and allogeneic donor (n = 3, with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) hsCAR-T cells were infused into 5 patients who had relapsed after receiving mCAR-T treatments. Two patients received mCAR-T treatments twice previously but the second treatments were ineffective. In contrast, subsequent hsCAR-T treatments proved effective in all 5 patients and achieved complete molecular remission in four, including one with extramedullary disease with central nervous system involvement. Conclusions: hsCD19 CAR-T treatment shows efficacy in highly treated B-ALL patients who have relapsed after receiving CD19 mCAR-T therapies.},

abstract = {Recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have evolved as the most promising technology for gene therapy due to their good safety profile, high transduction efficacy, and long-term gene expression in non-dividing cells. AAV-based gene therapy holds great promise for treating genetic disorders like inherited blindness, muscular atrophy, or bleeding disorders. Multiple naturally occurring and engineered AAV serotypes exist, which differ in capsid sequence and as a consequence in cellular tropism. Individual AAV capsids differ in thermal stability and have a characteristic melting temperature (Tm), which enables serotype-specific discrimination of AAV vectors. Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) combined with a dye-like SYPRO Orange (SO-DSF), which binds to hydrophobic regions of unfolded proteins, has been successfully applied to determine the Tm of AAV capsids. Here, we present DSF measurement of intrinsic fluorescence signal (iDSF) as a simple alternative method for determination of AAV capsid Tm. The study demonstrates that DSF measurement of intrinsic fluorescence signal is a simple, accurate, and rapid alternative to SO-DSF, which enables characterization of AAV capsid stability with excellent precision and without the need of SO or any other dye.},

abstract = {Receptor kinases of the Catharanthus roseus RLK1-like (CrRLK1L) family have emerged as important regulators of plant reproduction, growth and responses to the environment1. Endogenous RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) peptides2 have previously been proposed as ligands for several members of the CrRLK1L family1. However, the mechanistic basis of this perception is unknown. Here we report that RALF23 induces a complex between the CrRLK1L FERONIA (FER) and LORELEI (LRE)-LIKE GLYCOSYLPHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL (GPI)-ANCHORED PROTEIN 1 (LLG1) to regulate immune signalling. Structural and biochemical data indicate that LLG1 (which is genetically important for RALF23 responses) and the related LLG2 directly bind RALF23 to nucleate the assembly of RALF23–LLG1–FER and RALF23–LLG2–FER heterocomplexes, respectively. A conserved N-terminal region of RALF23 is sufficient for the biochemical recognition of RALF23 by LLG1, LLG2 or LLG3, and binding assays suggest that other RALF peptides that share this conserved N-terminal region may be perceived by LLG proteins in a similar manner. Structural data also show that RALF23 recognition is governed by the conformationally flexible C-terminal sides of LLG1, LLG2 and LLG3. Our work reveals a mechanism of peptide perception in plants by GPI-anchored proteins that act together with a phylogenetically unrelated receptor kinase. This provides a molecular framework for understanding how diverse RALF peptides may regulate multiple processes, through perception by distinct heterocomplexes of CrRLK1L receptor kinases and GPI-anchored proteins of the LRE and LLG family.},

abstract = {WRINKLED1 (WRI1), the transcriptional activator of fatty acid synthesis, was recently identified as a target of KIN10, a catalytic $\alpha$-subunit of the SUCROSE-NON-FERMENTING1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE1 (SnRK1). We tested the hypothesis that trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P), a signal of cellular sucrose status, can regulate fatty acid synthesis by inhibiting SnRK1. Incubation of Brassica napus suspension cells in medium containing T6P, or overexpression of the Escherichia coli T6P synthase, OtsA, in Nicotiana benthamiana, significantly increased T6P levels, WRI1 levels, and fatty acid synthesis rates. T6P directly bound to purified recombinant KIN10 with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 32 ± 6 $\mu$M based on microscale thermophoresis. GEMINIVIRUS REP-INTERACTING KINASE1 (GRIK1) bound to KIN10 (Kd 19 ± 3 $\mu$M) and activated it by phosphorylation. In the presence of T6P, the GRIK1-KIN10 association was weakened by more than 3-fold (Kd 68 ± 9.8 $\mu$M), which reduced both the phosphorylation of KIN10 and its activity. T6P-dependent inhibition of SnRK1 activity was reduced in extracts of individual Arabidopsis thaliana grik1 and grik2 mutants relative to the wild type, while SnRK1 activity in grik1 grik2 extracts was enhanced by T6P. These results indicate that the T6P sensitivity of SnRK1 in vivo is GRIK1/GRIK2 dependent. Based on our findings, we propose a mechanistic model that links sugar signaling and fatty acid homeostasis.},

Our group synthesized a series of enantiomeric $\alpha$-aminophosphonate derivatives with high anti-TMV activities. The activity of (R)-diphenyl-1-(4-methylbenzothiazole-2-amino)-1-(thiphene-2-yl)-methylphosphonate (Q-R) was found to be superior to that of (S)-diphenyl-1-(4-methyl benzothiazole-2-amino)-1-(thiphene-2-yl)-methylphosphonate (Q-S). However, the mechanism for inhibition of the R-isomer (Q-R) of infection activity is not clear. Thus, we studied the interactions between Q-R and Q-S and TMV by using TMV coat proteins (CP) as a potential target for fluorescence spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, microscale thermophoresis, and molecular docking. Arg90 was found to play a major role in the interaction of Q-R with TMV CP, as demonstrated by the interaction experiments and the results of molecular modeling. The substitution of arginine with glycine resulted in a mutant that was significantly less sensitive to Q-R. These results indicate that Q-R undermines the structural stability of the TMV R90G virus particle by binding with Arg90, eventually leading to the loss of the virus' ability for infection.},

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. Investigation of the dynamic regulation of the evolutionarily conserved exocyst-related processes using mutants in genetically tractable organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. An EXO70 protein with a C-terminal truncation results in dominant ES2 resistance, uncovering possible distinct regulatory roles for the N terminus of the protein. This study not only provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation but also offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease.},

This lack of effective antiviral agents is mainly due to the poor understanding of potential targets associated with TMV infections. During infection, the coat protein (CP), which is delivered by viral particles into susceptible host cells, provides protection for viral RNA. Here, we found that Ningnanmycin (NNM), a commercially used plant antibacterial agent, inhibits the assembly of the CP by directly binding several residues. These interactions cause the disassembly of the CP from discs into monomers, leading to an almost complete loss of pathogenicity. Substitutions in the involved binding residues resulted in mutants that were significantly less sensitive to NNM. Thus, targeting the binding of viral CPs through small molecular agents offers an effective strategy to study the mechanism of NNM.},

abstract = {Turfgrass are widely cultivated ornamental plants that have important ecological, societal and economical values. However, many turfgrass species are susceptible to drought and demand frequent irrigation thus consuming large amounts of water. With the ultimate goal of improving drought resistance in turfgrass, we identified several ABA receptors in turfgrass that are important to mediate ABA signaling and drought stress response. The ABA receptor FePYR1 from turfgrass Festuca elata was demonstrated to bind ABA as a monomer. Crystal structure analysis revealed that FePYR1 recognizes and binds ABA by the common gate-latch-lock mechanism resembling the Arabidopsis ABA receptors, but the ABA binding pocket in FePYR1 shows discrepant residues resulting in different binding affinity to ABA. Structure-guided alterations of amino acid residues in FePYR1 generated ABA receptor variants with significantly increased ABA binding affinity. Expression of FePYR1 in Arabidopsis conferred enhanced drought resistance in the transgenic plants. These findings provided detailed information about FePYR1 and demonstrated that structure-assisted engineering could create superior ABA receptors for improving plant drought resistance. The detailed structural information of FePYR1 would also assist future rational design of small molecules targeting specific ABA receptors in economically important plant species.},

Here we present the design and characterization of two-component protein NPs displaying 20 stabilized SOSIP trimers from various HIV-1 strains. The two-component nature permits the incorporation of exclusively well-folded, native-like Env trimers into NPs that self-assemble in vitro with high efficiency. Immunization studies show that the NPs are particularly efficacious as priming immunogens, improve the quality of the Ab response over a conventional one-component nanoparticle system, and are most effective when SOSIP trimers with an apex-proximate neutralizing epitope are displayed. Their ability to enhance and shape the immunogenicity of SOSIP trimers make these NPs a promising immunogen platform.},

It is not an agonist of the classical CB1/CB2 cannabinoid receptors and the mechanism by which it functions is unknown. Here, we studied the effects of CBD on various mitochondrial functions in BV-2 microglial cells. Our findings indicate that CBD treatment leads to a biphasic increase in intracellular calcium levels and to changes in mitochondrial function and morphology leading to cell death. Density gradient fractionation analysis by mass spectrometry and western blotting showed colocalization of CBD with protein markers of mitochondria. Single-channel recordings of the outer-mitochondrial membrane protein, the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) functioning in cell energy, metabolic homeostasis and apoptosis revealed that CBD markedly decreases channel conductance. Finally, using microscale thermophoresis, we showed a direct interaction between purified fluorescently labeled VDAC1 and CBD. Thus, VDAC1 seems to serve as a novel mitochondrial target for CBD.

abstract = {Introduction: DOF proteins are a family of plant-specific transcription factors with a conserved zinc finger (ZF) DNA-binding domain. Although several studies have demonstrated their specific DNA binding, quantitative affinity data is not available for the binding of DOF domains to their binding sites. Methods: ZF domains of DOF2.1, DOF3.4, and DOF5.8 from Arabidopsis thaliana were expressed and purified. Their DNA binding affinities were assessed using gel retardation assays and microscale thermophoresis with two different oligonucleotide probes containing one and two copies of recognition sequence AAAG. Results: DOF zinc finger domains (DOF-ZFs) were shown to form independently folded structures. Assessments using microscale thermophoresis demonstrated that DOF-ZFs interact more tightly ($\sim$100 fold) with double-motif probe than the single-motif probe. The overall Kd values for the DOF3.4-ZF and DOF5.8-ZF to the double-motif probe were $\sim$2.3±1 and 2.5±1 $\mu$M, respectively. Conclusion: Studied DOF-ZF domains formed stable complexes with the double-motif probe. Although DOF3.4-ZF and DOF5.8-ZF do not dimerize with an appreciable affinity in the absence of DNA (judging from size-exclusion and multiangle laser light scattering data), it is possible that these ZFs form protein-protein contacts when bound to this oligonucleotide, consistent with previous reports that DOF proteins can homo- and hetero-dimerize.},

abstract = {2',3'-cAMP is an intriguing small molecule that is conserved among different kingdoms. 2',3'-cAMP is presumably produced during RNA degradation, with increased cellular levels observed especially under stress conditions. Previously, we observed the presence of 2',3'-cAMP in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) protein complexes isolated from native lysate, suggesting that 2',3'-cAMP has potential protein partners in plants. Here, affinity purification experiments revealed that 2',3'-cAMP associates with the stress granule (SG) proteome. SGs are aggregates composed of protein and mRNA, which enable cells to selectively store mRNA for use in response to stress such as heat whereby translation initiation is impaired. Using size-exclusion chromatography and affinity purification analyses, we identified Rbp47b, the key component of SGs, as a potential interacting partner of 2',3'-cAMP. Furthermore, SG formation was promoted in 2',3'-cAMP-treated Arabidopsis seedlings, and interactions between 2',3'-cAMP and RNA-binding domains of Rbp47b, RRM2 and RRM3, were confirmed in vitro using microscale thermophoresis. Taken together, these results (1) describe novel small-molecule regulation of SG formation, (2) provide evidence for the biological role of 2',3'-cAMP, and (3) demonstrate an original biochemical pipeline for the identification of protein-metabolite interactors.},

abstract = {Photosystem II (PSII) is the most thermolabile photosynthetic complex. Physiological evidence suggests that the small chloroplast heat-shock protein 21 (HSP21) is involved in plant thermotolerance, but the molecular mechanism of its action remains largely unknown. Here, we have provided genetic and biochemical evidence that HSP21 is activated by the GUN5-dependent retrograde signaling pathway, and stabilizes PSII by directly binding to its core subunits such as D1 and D2 proteins under heat stress. We further demonstrate that the constitutive expression of HSP21 sufficiently rescues the thermosensitive stability of PSII and survival defects of the gun5 mutant with dramatically improving granal stacking under heat stress, indicating that HSP21 is a key chaperone protein in maintaining the integrity of the thylakoid membrane system under heat stress. In line with our interpretation based on several lines of in vitro and in vivo protein-interaction evidence that HSP21 interacts with core subunits of PSII, the kinetics of HSP21 binding to the D1 and D2 proteins was determined by performing an analysis of microscale thermophoresis. Considering the major role of HSP21 in protecting the core subunits of PSII from thermal damage, its heat-responsive activation via the heat-shock transcription factor HsfA2 is critical for the survival of plants under heat stress. Our findings reveal an auto-adaptation loop pathway that plant cells optimize particular needs of chloroplasts in stabilizing photosynthetic complexes by relaying the GUN5-dependent plastid signal(s) to activate the heat-responsive expression of HSP21 in the nucleus during adaptation to heat stress in plants.},

abstract = {The two Arabidopsis basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factors GLABRA3 (GL3) and ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 (EGL3) are positive regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis, and form protein complexes (MBW complexes) with various R2R3 MYB transcription factors and a WD40 repeat protein TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABROUS1 (TTG1). In earlier studies, GL3, in contrast to EGL3, was shown to be essential for accumulation of anthocyanins in response to nitrogen depletion. This could not be fully explained by the strong induction of GL3 in response to nitrogen depletion because the EGL3 transcripts were constitutively at a relatively high level and transcripts levels of the two genes were similar under nitrogen depletion. Here the GL3 and EGL3 proteins were characterized with respect to their affinities for PRODUCTION OF ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT2 (PAP2), a R2R3-MYB which is induced by nitrogen depletion and is part of MBW complexes promoting anthocyanin synthesis. GL3 and EGL3 were also tested for their binding to MYBL2, a negative regulator of anthocyanin synthesis and MBW complexes. Using heterologously expressed proteins and Microscale Thermophoresis, GL3 showed binding constants (Kd) of 3.5 ± 1.7 and 22.7 ± 3.7 $\mu$M, whereas EGL3 showed binding constants of 7.5 ± 2.3 and 8.9 ± 1.4 $\mu$M for PAP2 and MYBL2, respectively. This implies that MYBL2 will not inhibit a MBW complex containing GL3 as easily as for a complex containing EGL3. In transgenic plants where EGL3 reaches high concentrations compared with MYBL2 the equilibrium is shifted and MYBL2 is not likely to be an efficient competitor, hence anthocyanin formation could be restored by either EGL3 or GL3 genes when overexpressed by help of the 35S promoter. The present work underpins that GL3 is essential for anthocyanin accumulation under nitrogen depletion not only due to transcriptional activation, but also because of binding properties to proteins promoting or inhibiting the activity of the MBW complex.},

CRL activity is controlled by several proteins or protein complexes, including NEDD8, CAND1, and the CSN. Recently, a mammalian protein called Glomulin (GLMN) was shown to inhibit CRLs by binding to the RING BOX (RBX1) subunit and preventing binding to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Here, we show that Arabidopsis ABERRANT LATERAL ROOT FORMATION4 (ALF4) is an ortholog of GLMN. The alf4 mutant exhibits a phenotype that suggests defects in plant hormone response. We show that ALF4 binds to RBX1 and inhibits the activity of SCF TIR 1 , an E3 ligase responsible for degradation of the Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors. In vivo, the alf4 mutation destabilizes the CUL1 subunit of the SCF. Reduced CUL1 levels are associated with increased levels of the Aux/IAA proteins as well as the DELLA repressors, substrate of SCF SLY 1 . We propose that the alf4 phenotype is partly due to increased levels of the Aux/IAA and DELLA proteins.},

Here, we show that the Lotus japonicus Nod factor receptor 5 (NFR5) and Nod factor receptor 1 (NFR1) bind Nod factor directly at high-affinity binding sites. Both receptor proteins were posttranslationally processed when expressed as fusion proteins and extracted from purified membrane fractions of Nicotiana benthamiana or Arabidopsis thaliana. The N-terminal signal peptides were cleaved, and NFR1 protein retained its in vitro kinase activity. Processing of NFR5 protein was characterized by determining the N-glycosylation patterns of the ectodomain. Two different glycan structures with identical composition, Man 3XylFucGlcNAc 4, were identified by mass spectrometry and located at amino acid positions N68 and N198. Receptor-ligand interaction was measured by using ligands that were labeled or immobilized by application of chemo-selective chemistry at the anomeric center. High-affinity ligand binding was demonstrated with both solid-phase and free solution techniques. The K d values obtained for Nod factor binding were in the nanomolar range and comparable to the concentration range sufficient for biological activity. Structure-dependent ligand specificity was shown by using chitin oligosaccharides. Taken together, our results suggest that ligand recognition through direct ligand binding is a key step in the receptor-mediated activation mechanism leading to root nodule development in legumes.},

abstract = {The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction module involved in transducing extracellular signals to the nucleus for appropriate cellular adjustment. This cascade essentially consists of three components: a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK), a MAPK kinase, and a MAPK, connected to each other by the event of phosphorylation. Here, we report the characterization of a MAPKKK, ABA-INSENSITIVE PROTEIN KINASE1 (AIK1), which regulates abscisic acid (ABA) responses in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). T-DNA insertion mutants of AIK1 showed insensitivity to ABA in terms of both root growth and stomatal response. AIK1 functions in ABA responses via regulation of root cell division and elongation, as well as stomatal responses. The activity of AIK1 is induced by ABA in Arabidopsis and tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana), and the Arabidopsis protein phosphatase type 2C, ABI1, a negative regulator of ABA signaling, restricts AIK1 activity by dephosphorylation. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis showed that MPK3, MPK6, and AIK1 interact with MKK5. The single mutant seedlings of mpk6 and mkk5 have similar phenotypes to aik1, but mkk4 does not. AIK1 was localized in the cytoplasm and shown to activate MKK5 by protein phosphorylation, which was an ABA-activated process. Constitutively active MKK5 in aik1 mutant seedlings complements the ABA-insensitive root growth phenotype of aik1. The activity of MPK6 was increased by ABA in wild-type seedlings, but its activation by ABA was impaired in aik1 and aik1 mkk5 mutants. These findings clearly suggest that the AIK1-MKK5-MPK6 cascade functions in the ABA regulation of primary root growth and stomatal response.},

abstract = {The small heat shock protein (sHsp) chaperones are crucial for cell survival and can prevent aggregation of client proteins that partially unfold under destabilizing conditions. Most investigations on the chaperone activity of sHsps are based on a limited set of thermosensitive model substrate client proteins since the endogenous targets are often not known. There is a high diversity among sHsps with a single conserved $\beta$-sandwich fold domain defining the family, the $\alpha$-crystallin domain, whereas the N-terminal and C-terminal regions are highly variable in length and sequence among various sHsps and conserved only within orthologues. The endogenous targets are probably also varying among various sHsps, cellular compartments, cell type and organism. Here we have investigated Hsp21, a non-metazoan sHsp expressed in the chloroplasts in green plants which experience huge environmental fluctuations not least in temperature. We describe how Hsp21 can also interact with the chloroplast thylakoid membranes, both when isolated thylakoid membranes are incubated with Hsp21 protein and when plants are heat-stressed. The amount of Hsp21 associated with the thylakoid membranes was precisely determined by quantitative mass spectrometry after metabolic 15N-isotope labeling of either recombinantly expressed and purified Hsp21 protein or intact Arabidopsis thaliana plants. We found that Hsp21 is among few proteins that become associated with the thylakoid membranes in heat-stressed plants, and that approximately two thirds of the pool of chloroplast Hsp21 is affected. We conclude that for a complete picture of the role of sHsps in plant stress resistance also their association with the membranes should be considered.},

Prior to this event, two of the three subunits, the AAA+ proteins ChlI and ChlD, form a ChlID-MgATP complex. We used microscale thermophoresis to directly determine dissociation constants for the I-D subunits from Synechocystis, and to show that the formation of a ChlID-MgADP complex, mediated by the arginine finger and the sensor II domain on ChlD, is necessary for the assembly of the catalytically active ChlHID-MgATP complex. The N-terminal AAA+ domain of ChlD is essential for complex formation, but some stability is preserved in the absence of the C-terminal integrin domain of ChlD, particularly if the intervening polyproline linker region is retained. Single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) was used to determine the factors that stabilize formation of the ChlID-MgADP complex at the single molecule level; ChlD was attached to an atomic force microscope (AFM) probe in two different orientations, and the ChlI subunits were tethered to a silica surface; the probability of subunits interacting more than doubled in the presence of MgADP, and we show that the N-terminal AAA+ domain of ChlD mediates this process, in agreement with the microscale thermophoresis data. Analysis of the unbinding data revealed a most probable interaction force of around 109 pN for formation of single ChlID-MgADP complexes. These experiments provide a quantitative basis for understanding the assembly and function of the Mg chelatase complex.},

abstract = {Ethylene signaling is decisive for many plant developmental processes. Among these, control of senescence, abscission and fruit ripening are of fundamental relevance for global agriculture. Consequently, detailed knowledge of the signaling network along with the molecular processes of signal perception and transfer are expected to have high impact on future food production and agriculture. Recent advances in ethylene research have demonstrated that signaling of the plant hormone critically depends on the interaction of the ethylene receptor family with the NRAMP-like membrane protein ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 2 (EIN2) at the ER membrane, phosphorylation-dependent proteolytic processing of ER-localized EIN2 and subsequent translocation of the cleaved EIN2 C-terminal polypeptide (EIN2-CEND) to the nucleus. EIN2 nuclear transport, but also interaction with the receptors sensing the ethylene signal, both, depend on a nuclear localization signal (NLS) located at the EIN2 C-terminus. Loss of the tight interaction between receptors and EIN2 affects ethylene signaling and impairs plant ethylene responses. Synthetic peptides derived from the NLS sequence interfere with the EIN2–receptor interaction and have utility in controlling plant ethylene responses such as ripening. Here, we report that a synthetic peptide (NOP-1) corresponding to the NLS motif of Arabidopsis EIN2 (aa 1262–1269) efficiently binds to tomato ethylene receptors LeETR4 and NR and delays ripening in the post-harvest phase when applied to the surface of sampled green fruits pre-harvest. In particular, degradation of chlorophylls was delayed by several days, as monitored by optical sensors and confirmed by analytical methods. Similarly, accumulation of b-carotene and lycopene in the fruit pulp after NOP-1 application was delayed, without having impact on the total pigment concentration in the completely ripe fruits. Likewise, the peptide had no negative effects on fruit quality. Our molecular and phenotypic studies reveal that peptide biologicals could contribute to the development of a novel family of ripening inhibitors and innovative ripening control in climacteric fruit.},

abstract = {Transcription activator-like effector (TALE) proteins of the plant pathogenic bacterial genus Xanthomonas bind to and transcriptionally activate host susceptibility genes, promoting disease. Plant immune systems have taken advantage of this mechanism by evolving TALE binding sites upstream of resistance (R) genes. For example, the pepper Bs3 and rice Xa27 genes are hypersensitive reaction plant R genes that are transcriptionally activated by corresponding TALEs. Both R genes have a hallmark expression pattern in which their transcripts are detectable only in the presence and not the absence of the corresponding TALE. By transcriptome profiling using next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq), we tested whether we could avoid laborious positional cloning for the isolation of TALE-induced R genes. In a proof-of-principle experiment, RNA-seq was used to identify a candidate for Bs4C, an R gene from pepper that mediates recognition of the Xanthomonas TALE protein AvrBs4. We identified one major Bs4C candidate transcript by RNA-seq that was expressed exclusively in the presence of AvrBs4. Complementation studies confirmed that the candidate corresponds to the Bs4C gene and that an AvrBs4 binding site in the Bs4C promoter directs its transcriptional activation. Comparison of Bs4C with a nonfunctional allele that is unable to recognize AvrBs4 revealed a 2-bp polymorphism within the TALE binding site of the Bs4C promoter. Bs4C encodes a structurally unique R protein and Bs4C-like genes that are present in many solanaceous genomes seem to be as tightly regulated as pepper Bs4C. These findings demonstrate that TALE-specific R genes can be cloned from large-genome crops with a highly efficient RNA-seq approach.},

abstract = {As sessile organisms, plants must adapt to variations in the environment. Environmental stress triggers various responses, including growth inhibition, mediated by the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA). The mechanisms that integrate stress responses with growth are poorly understood. Here, we discovered that the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase phosphorylates PYL ABA receptors at a conserved serine residue to prevent activation of the stress response in unstressed plants. This phosphorylation disrupts PYL association with ABA and with PP2C phosphatase effectors, leading to inactivation of SnRK2 kinases. Under stress, ABA-activated SnRK2s phosphorylate Raptor, a component of the TOR complex, triggering TOR complex dissociation and inhibition. Thus, TOR signaling represses ABA signaling and stress responses in unstressed conditions, whereas ABA signaling represses TOR signaling and growth during times of stress. Plants utilize this conserved phospho-regulatory feedback mechanism to optimize the balance of growth and stress responses. Wang et al. reveal that the TOR kinase phosphorylates ABA receptors to repress stress responses under unstressed conditions and to promote growth recovery once environmental stresses subside. Under stress conditions, SnRK2s phosphorylate Raptor, a regulatory component in the TOR complex, to prevent growth by inhibiting TOR activity.},

The traditional Chinese herbs Dengzhan Shengmai (DZSM) capsules and their active component scutellarin possess multiple effects and are clinically used for the treatment of cerebrovascular diseases. Scutellarin has been reported to affect A$\beta$ aggregation. However, the effects of DZSM capsules on AD remain unknown. Through in vivo experiments, our study proved that the alleviating effects of DZSM capsules on cognitive deficits of AD mice were due to the role of scutellarin, which up-regulated low toxic amyloid plaques and down-regulated highly toxic soluble A$\beta$42 and A$\beta$40 levels in cortex. In vitro, we confirmed scutellarin's role in accelerating transforming A$\beta$42 monomers into high-molecular-mass aggregates by biochemical assays, which supported the results observed in drug-treated APP/PS1 mice. In detail, the 1:10 ratio of scutellarin/A$\beta$42 mixtures promoted production of large $\beta$-sheet-rich fibrils whereas the 1:1 ratio promoted production of protofibrils. In addition, the binding between scutellarin and A$\beta$ monomers was quantified by microscale thermophoresis test and the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) was 1284.4 ± 238.8 $\mu$M. What's more, binding regions between scutellarin and A$\beta$ fibrils were predicted by computational docking models and scutellarin might bind parallel to the long axis of A$\beta$42 fibrils targeting hydrophobic grooves at residues 35–36 or 39. In conclusion, DZSM capsules protected against cognitive defects of AD through scutellarin-mediated acceleration of A$\beta$ aggregation into fibrils or protofibrils and reduction of soluble A$\beta$ oligomers, thus suggesting potential clinical applications of DZSM capsules and scutellarin in the treatment of AD.},

We show that DJ-1 physically binds the 20S proteasome and inhibits its activity, rescuing partially unfolded proteins from degradation. Consequently, DJ-1 stabilizes the cellular levels of 20S proteasome substrates, as we show for $\alpha$-synuclein and p53. Furthermore, we demonstrate that following oxidative stress, DJ-1 is involved in the Nrf2-dependent oxidative stress response that leads to the upregulation of both the 20S proteasome and its regulator, NQO1. Overall, our results suggest a regulatory circuit in which DJ-1, under conditions of oxidative stress, both upregulates and inhibits the 20S proteasome, providing a rigorous control mechanism at a time when the 20S proteasome becomes the major proteolytic machinery. Such a tight regulation of the 20S proteasome may sustain the balance between the need to rapidly eliminate oxidatively damaged proteins and maintain the abundance of native, intrinsically unstructured proteins, which coordinate regulatory and signalling events.},

Alpha-synuclein ($\alpha$-syn) is a small soluble protein expressed primarily at presynaptic terminals in the central nervous system. In our present study, we explored the interactions between CN and $\alpha$-syn in vitro. Based on the data from microscale thermophoresis, GST pull-down assays, and co-immunoprecipitation, we found that CN binds $\alpha$-syn. Furthermore, this interaction is mediated by calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) signaling. Additionally, thapsigargin (TG) triggered an increase in CN activity and $\alpha$-syn aggregation in HEK293 cells stably transfected with $\alpha$-syn. Our previous study in vivo suggest that overexpression of $\alpha$-syn in transgenic mice significantly promoted CN activity and subsequent nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) in the midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons. These in vivo and in vitro studies have been complementary with each other, representing the changes in the CN-dependent pathway affected by overexpression of $\alpha$-syn.},

abstract = {Background: Brain amyloid deposition is one of the main pathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Soluble oligomers formed during the process that causes $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) to aggregate into plaques are considered to have major neurotoxicity. Currently, drug development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease has encountered serious difficulties. Our newly proposed solution is to accelerate the aggregation of A$\beta$ to reduce the amount of cytotoxic A$\beta$ oligomers in brain tissue. This strategy differs from the existing strategy of reducing the total A$\beta$ content and the number of amyloid plaques. Method: In this study, we screened a small library and found that a flavonoid compound (ZGM1) promoted the aggregation of $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$). We further verified the binding of ZGM1 to A$\beta$42 using a microscale thermophoresis (MST) assay. Subsequently, we used dot blotting (DB), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and thioflavin T fluorescence (ThT) measurements to study the aggregation of A$\beta$ under the influence of ZGM1. By using cell experiments, we determined whether ZGM1 can inhibit the cytotoxicity of A$\beta$. Finally, we studied the protective effects of ZGM1 on cognitive function in APPswe/PS1 mice via behavioral experiments and measured the number of plaques in the mouse brain by thioflavin staining. Results: ZGM1 can bind with A$\beta$ directly and mediate a new A$\beta$ assembly process to form reticular aggregates and reduce the amount of A$\beta$ oligomers. Animal experiments showed that ZGM1 can significantly improve cognitive dysfunction and that A$\beta$ plaque deposition in the brain tissue of mice in the drug-administered group was significantly increased. Conclusion: Our research suggests that promoting A$\beta$ aggregation is a promising treatment method for AD and deserves further investigation.},

A few compounds have been developed to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation, but compounds directly and specifically targeting NLRP3 are still not available, so it is unclear whether NLRP3 itself can be targeted to prevent or treat diseases. Here we show that the compound CY-09 specifically blocks NLRP3 inflammasome activation. CY-09 directly binds to the ATP-binding motif of NLRP3 NACHT domain and inhibits NLRP3 ATPase activity, resulting in the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation. Importantly, treatment with CY-09 shows remarkable therapeutic effects on mouse models of cryopyrin-associated autoinflammatory syndrome (CAPS) and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, CY-09 is active ex vivo for monocytes from healthy individuals or synovial fluid cells from patients with gout. Thus, our results provide a selective and direct small-molecule inhibitor for NLRP3 and indicate that NLRP3 can be targeted in vivo to combat NLRP3-driven diseases.},

In this work, we report an aptamer discovery method that enables us to generate high-quality structure-switching aptamers (SSAs) that undergo a conformational change upon binding a metal ion target, without the requirement of labels or chemical modifications. Our method is more efficient than conventional selection methods because it enables direct measurement of target binding via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), isolating only the desired aptamers with the highest affinity. Using this strategy, we obtained a highly specific DNA SSA with ∼30-fold higher affinity than the best aptamer for Hg2+ in the literature. We also discovered DNA aptamers that bind to Cu2+ with excellent affinity and specificity. Both aptamers were obtained within four rounds of screening, demonstrating the efficiency of our aptamer discovery method. Given the growing availability of FACS, we believe our method offers a general strategy for discovering high-quality aptamers for other ions and small-molecule targets in an efficient and reproducible manner.},

abstract = {The aggregation of amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) into oligomers and fibrillary structures is critical for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, research effort has been focused on developing novel agents that can preferentially suppress A$\beta$ oligomer mediated toxicities, for example, by directly targeting these toxic assemblies. The compound RD2 has been developed and optimized for A$\beta$42 monomer binding and stabilization of the monomer in its native intrinsically disordered conformation. It has been demonstrated to improve and even reverse the cognitive and behavioral deficits in AD mouse models, while the detailed mechanism of action is not fully clarified. Here we focused on exploring the interaction between RD2 and A$\beta$42 monomers and its consequences for the fibrillation of A$\beta$42. RD2 binds to A$\beta$42 monomers with nanomolar affinities, according to microscale thermophoresis and surface plasmon resonance measurements. Complexes between RD2 and A$\beta$42 monomers are formed at 1:1 and other stoichiometries, as revealed by analytical ultracentrifugation. At substoichiometric levels, RD2 slows down the secondary structure conversion of A$\beta$42 and significantly delays the fibril formation. Our research provides experimental evidence in supporting that RD2 eliminates toxic A$\beta$ assemblies by stabilizing A$\beta$ monomers in their native intrinsically disordered conformation. The study further supports the promising application of RD2 in counteracting A$\beta$ aggregation related pathologies.},

abstract = {The therapeutic targeting of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) by small molecules has been a challenge due to their heterogeneous conformational ensembles. A potential therapeutic strategy to alleviate the aggregation of IDPs is to maintain them in their native monomeric state by small molecule binding. This study investigates the structural basis of small molecule druggability of native monomeric Tau whose aggregation is linked to the onset of Tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease. Initially, two available monomeric conformational ensembles of a shorter Tau construct K18 (also termed Tau4RD) were analyzed which revealed striking structural differences between the two ensembles, while similar number of hot spots and small molecule binding sites were identified on monomeric Tau ensembles as on tertiary folded proteins of similar size. Remarkably, some critical fibril forming sequence regions of Tau (V306-K311, V275-K280) participated in hot spot formation with higher frequency compared to other regions. As an example of small molecule binding to monomeric Tau, it was shown that methylene blue (MB) bound to monomeric K18 and full-length Tau selectively with high affinity (K d = 125.8 nM and 86.6 nM, respectively) with binding modes involving Cys291 and Cys322, previously reported to be oxidized in the presence of MB. Overall, our results provide structure-based evidence that Tau can be a viable drug target for small molecules and indicate that specific small molecules may be able to bind to monomeric Tau and influence the way in which the protein interacts among itself and with other proteins.},

However, their wide and polar catalytic sites make them a challenging target for orthosteric inhibition. In this work, we conceived to target LDH tetramerization sites with the ambition of disrupting their oligomeric state. To do so, we designed a protein model of a dimeric LDH-H. We exploited this model through WaterLOGSY nuclear magnetic resonance and microscale thermophoresis for the identification and characterization of a set of $\alpha$-helical peptides and stapled derivatives that specifically targeted the LDH tetramerization sites. This strategy resulted in the design of a macrocyclic peptide that competes with the LDH tetramerization domain, thus disrupting and destabilizing LDH tetramers. These peptides and macrocycles, along with the dimeric model of LDH-H, constitute promising pharmacological tools for the de novo design and identification of LDH tetramerization disruptors. Overall, our study demonstrates that disrupting LDH oligomerization state by targeting their tetramerization sites is achievable and paves the way toward LDH inhibition through this novel molecular mechanism.},

abstract = {Nonstructural protein 15 (Nsp15) encoded by coronavirus (CoV) is a nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) that plays an essential role in the life cycle of the virus. Structural information on this crucial protein from the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), which is lethally pathogenic and has caused severe respiratory diseases worldwide, is lacking. Here, we determined the crystal structure of MERS-CoV Nsp15 at a 2.7-{\AA} resolution and performed the relevant biochemical assays to study how NendoU activity is regulated. Although the overall structure is conserved, MERS-CoV Nsp15 shows unique and novel features compared to its homologs. Serine substitution of residue F285, which harbors an aromatic side chain that disturbs RNA binding compared with that of other homologs, increases catalytic activity. Mutations of residues residing on the oligomerization interfaces that distort hexamerization, namely, N38A, Y58A, and N157A, decrease thermostability, decrease affinity of binding with RNA, and reduce the NendoU activity of Nsp15. In contrast, mutant D39A exhibits increased activity and a higher substrate binding capacity. Importantly, Nsp8 was found to interact with both monomeric and hexameric Nsp15. The Nsp7/Nsp8 complex displays a higher binding affinity for Nsp15. Furthermore, Nsp8 and the Nsp7/Nsp8 complex also enhance the NendoU activity of hexameric Nsp15 in vitro . Taking the findings together, this work first provides evidence on how the activity of Nsp15 may be functionally mediated by catalytic residues, oligomeric assembly, RNA binding efficiency, or the possible association with other nonstructural proteins. IMPORTANCE The lethally pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) pose serious threats to humans. Endoribonuclease Nsp15 encoded by coronavirus plays an important role in viral infection and pathogenesis. This study determines the structure of MERS-CoV Nsp15 and demonstrates how the catalytic activity of this protein is potentially mediated, thereby providing structural and functional evidence for developing antiviral drugs. We also hypothesize that the primase-like protein Nsp8 and the Nsp7/Nsp8 complex may interact with Nsp15 and affect enzymatic activity. This contributes to the understanding of the association of Nsp15 with the viral replication and transcription machinery.},

abstract = {Visceral adipose tissue derived serine protease inhibitor (vaspin) is a member of the serpin family and has been shown to have beneficial effects on glucose tolerance, insulin stability as well as adipose tissue inflammation, parameters seriously affected by obesity. Some of these effects require inhibition of target proteases such as kallikrein 7(KLK7) and many studies have demonstrated vaspin-mediated activation of intracellular signaling cascades in various cells and tissues. So far, little is known about the exact mechanism how vaspin may trigger these intracellular signaling events. In this study, we investigated and characterized the interaction of vaspin with membrane lipids and polyphosphates as well as their potential regulatory effects on serpin activity using recombinant vaspin and KLK7 proteins and functional protein variants thereof. Here, we show for the first time that vaspin binds to phospholipids and polyphosphates with varying effects on KLK7 inhibition. Vaspin binds strongly to monophosphorylated phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PtdInsP) with no effect on vaspin activation. Microscale thermophoresis (MST) measurements revealed high-affinity binding to polyphosphate 45 (KD: 466 ± 75 nM) and activation of vaspin in a heparin-like manner. Furthermore, we identified additional residues in the heparin binding site in $\beta$-sheet A by mutating five basic residues resulting in complete loss of high-affinity heparin binding. Finally, using lipid overlay assays, we show that these residues are additionally involved in PtdInsP binding. Phospholipids play a major role in membrane trafficking and signaling whereas polyphosphates are procoagulant and proinflammatory agents. The identification of phospholipids and polyphosphates as binding partners of vaspin will contribute to the understanding of vaspins involvement in membrane trafficking, signaling and beneficial effects associated with obesity.},

abstract = {The venom of Cupiennius salei is composed of dozens of neurotoxins, with most of them supposed to act on ion channels. Some insecticidal monomeric neurotoxins contain an $\alpha$-helical part besides their inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) motif (type 1). Other neurotoxins have, besides the ICK motif, an $\alpha$-helical part of an open loop, resulting in a heterodimeric structure (type 2). Due to their low toxicity, it is difficult to understand the existence of type 2 peptides. Here, we show with the voltage clamp technique in oocytes of Xenopus laevis that a combined application of structural type 1 and type 2 neurotoxins has a much more pronounced cytolytic effect than each of the toxins alone. In biotests with Drosophila melanogaster, the combined effect of both neurotoxins was enhanced by 2 to 3 log units when compared to the components alone. Electrophysiological measurements of a type 2 peptide at 18 ion channel types, expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, showed no effect. Microscale thermophoresis data indicate a monomeric/heterodimeric peptide complex formation, thus a direct interaction between type 1 and type 2 peptides, leading to cell death. In conclusion, peptide mergers between both neurotoxins are the main cause for the high cytolytic activity of Cupiennius salei venom.},

Here we describe the in vitro selection of an unnatural nucleic acid polymer system based on $\alpha$-L-threofuranosyl nucleic acid (TNA) that is completely refractory to nuclease digestion. The use of an engi-neered TNA polymerase permitted the isolation of func-tional TNA aptamers that bind to HIV reverse transcrip-tase (HIV RT) with KD values of $\sim$0.4 to 4.0 nM. The TNA aptamers remain active in the presence of strong nucle-olytic enzymes, where DNA and FANA aptamers rapidly degrade, and exhibit markedly higher thermal stability than monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which irreversibly unfold at elevated temperatures. The combined proper-ties of biological stability, high target binding affinity, and thermal stability make TNA aptamers a powerful system for further development as future diagnostic and therapeutic agents.},

abstract = {Coronaviruses are responsible for upper and lower respiratory tract infections in humans. It is estimated that 1 to 10% of the population suffers annually from cold-like symptoms related to infection with human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), an alphacoronavirus. The nucleocapsid (N) protein, the major structural component of the capsid, facilitates RNA packing, links the capsid to the envelope, and is also involved in multiple other processes, including viral replication and evasion of the immune system. Although the role of N protein in viral replication is relatively well described, no structural data are currently available regarding the N proteins of alphacoronaviruses. Moreover, our understanding of the mechanisms of RNA binding and nucleocapsid formation remains incomplete. In this study, we solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal domains (NTD, residues 10 to 140, and CTD, residues 221 to 340, respectively) of the N protein of HCoV-NL63, both at a 1.5-{\AA} resolution. Based on our structure of NTD solved here, we proposed and experimentally evaluated a model of RNA binding. The structure of the CTD reveals the mode of N protein dimerization. Overall, this study expands our understanding of the initial steps of N protein-nucleic acid interaction and may facilitate future efforts to control the associated infections. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are responsible for the common cold and other respiratory tract infections in humans. According to multiple studies, 1 to 10% of the population is infected each year with HCoV-NL63. Viruses are relatively simple organisms composed of a few proteins and the nucleic acids that carry the information determining their composition. The nucleocapsid (N) protein studied in this work protects the nucleic acid from the environmental factors during virus transmission. This study investigated the structural arrangement of N protein, explaining the first steps of its interaction with nucleic acid at the initial stages of virus structure assembly. The results expand our understanding of coronavirus physiology and may facilitate future efforts to control the associated infections.},

abstract = {One of the major challenges in formulation development of biopharmaceuticals is improving long-term storage stability, which is often achieved by addition of excipients to the final formulation. Finding the optimal excipient for a given protein is usually done using a trial-and-error approach, due to the lack of general understanding of how excipients work for a particular protein. Previously, preferential interactions (binding or exclusion) of excipients with proteins were postulated as a mechanism explaining diversity in the stabilisation effects. Weak preferential binding is however difficult to quantify experimentally, and the question remains whether the formulation process should seek excipients which preferentially bind with proteins, or not. Here, we apply solution NMR spectroscopy to comprehensively evaluate protein-excipient interactions between therapeutically relevant proteins and commonly used excipients. Additionally, we evaluate the effect of excipients on thermal and colloidal protein stability, on aggregation kinetics and protein storage stability at elevated temperatures. We show that there is a weak negative correlation between the strength of protein-excipient interactions and effect on enhancing protein thermal stability. We found that the overall protein-excipient binding per se can be a poor criterion for choosing excipients enhancing formulation stability. Experiments on a diverse set of excipients and test proteins reveal that while excipients affect all of the different aspects of protein stability, the effects are very much protein specific, and care must be taken to avoid apparent generalisations if a smaller dataset is being used.},

Morganella psychrotolerans is a Gram-negative psychrophilic bacterium that is able to tolerate relatively high concentrations of Cu and Ag ions, and it is through the associated resistance pathways that this species is able to convert metal ions to nanoparticles. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of nanoparticle synthesis, looking at the interaction of the metal binding protein SilE with metal ions using MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST). MST assays give a rapid and accurate determination of binding affinities, allowing for the testing of SilE with a range of environmentally significant metal ions. The binding affinities (Kd) of Ag+ and Cu2+ were measured as 0.17 mM and 0.13 mM respectively, consistent with the observations of strong binding reported in the literature, whereas the binding to Al3+ and Co2+ was measured as Kd values of 4.19 mM and 1.35 mM respectively.},

However, in vitro the Gag specificity towards viral RNA is obscured when measured in buffers containing physiological salt. Interestingly, when the binding is challenged by increased salt concentration, the addition of competing RNAs, or introducing mutations to Gag protein, the specificity towards viral RNA becomes detectable. The objective of this work was to examine the contributions of the individual HIV-1 Gag polyprotein domains to nonspecific and specific RNA binding and stability of the initial protein-RNA complexes. Using a panel of Gag proteins with mutations disabling different Gag-Gag or Gag-RNA interfaces, we investigated the distinct contributions of individual domains which distinguish the binding to viral and nonviral RNA by measuring the binding of the proteins to RNAs. We measured the binding affinity in near-physiological salt concentration, and then challenged the binding by increasing the ionic strength to suppress the electrostatic interactions and reveal the contribution of specific Gag-RNA and Gag-Gag interactions. Surprisingly, we observed that Gag dimerization and the highly basic region in the matrix domain contribute significantly to the specificity of viral RNA binding.},

abstract = {Bispecific antibodies come in many different formats, including the particularly interesting two-in-one antibodies, where one conventional IgG binds two different antigens. The IgG format allows these antibodies to mediate Fc-related functionality, and their wild-type structure ensures low immunogenicity and enables standard methods to be used for development. It is however difficult, time-consuming and costly to generate two-in-one antibodies. Herein we demonstrate a new approach to create a similar type of antibody by combining two different variable heavy (VH) domains in each Fab arm of an IgG, a tetra-VH IgG format. The VHs are used as building blocks, where one VH is placed at its usual position, and the second VH replaces the variable light (VL) domain in a conventional IgG. VH domains, binding several different types of antigens, were discovered and could be rearranged in any combination, offering a convenient “plug and play” format. The tetra-VH IgGs were found to be functionally tetravalent, binding two antigens on each arm of the IgG molecule simultaneously. This offers a new strategy to also create monospecific, tetravalent IgGs that, depending on antigen architecture and mode-of-action, may have enhanced efficacy compared to traditional bivalent antibodies.},

abstract = {Inflammasomes are multi-protein signalling scaffolds that assemble in response to invasive pathogens and sterile danger signals to activate inflammatory caspases (1/4/5/11), which trigger inflammatory death (pyroptosis) and processing and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines1,2. Inflammasome activation contributes to many human diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, gout, type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, and sepsis, the often fatal response to systemic infection3-6. The recent identification of the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) as the final pyroptosis executioner downstream of inflammasome activation presents an attractive drug target for these diseases7-11. Here we show that disulfiram, a drug used to treat alcohol addiction12, and Bay 11-7082, a previously identified NF-$\kappa$B inhibitor13, potently inhibit GSDMD pore formation in liposomes and inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis and IL-1$\beta$ secretion in human and mouse cells. Moreover, disulfiram, administered at aclinically well-tolerated dose, inhibits LPS-induced septic death and IL-1$\beta$ secretion in mice. Both compounds covalently modify a conserved Cys (Cys191 in human and Cys192 in mouse GSDMD) that is critical for pore formation8,14. Inflammatory caspases employ Cys active sites, and many previously identified inhibitors of inflammatory mediators, including those against NLRP3 and NF-$\kappa$B, covalently modify reactive cysteine residues15. Since NLRP3 and noncanonical inflammasome activation are amplified by cellular oxidative stress16-22, these redox-sensitive reactive cysteine residues may regulate inflammation endogenously, and compounds that covalently modify reactive cysteines may inhibit inflammation by acting at multiple steps. Indeed, both disulfiram and Bay 11-7082 also directly inhibit inflammatory caspases and pleiotropically suppress multiple processes in inflammation triggered by both canonical and noncanonical inflammasomes, including priming, puncta formation and caspase activation. Hence, cysteine-reactive compounds, despite their lack of specificity, may be attractive agents for reducing inflammation.},

Recently it was shown that zinc ions can provoke the aggregation of endogenous TDP-43 in cells, allowing to assume a direct interaction of TDP-43 with zinc ions. In this work, we investigated zinc binding to the 102-269 TDP-43 fragment, which comprise the two RNA recognition motifs. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, mass spectrometry, and differential scanning fluorimetry, we showed that zinc binds to this TDP-43 domain with a dissociation constant in the micromolar range and modifies its tertiary structure leading to a decrease of its thermostability. Moreover, the study by dynamic light scattering and negative stain electron microscopy demonstrated that zinc ions induce auto-association process of this TDP-43 fragment into rope-like structures. These structures are thioflavin-T-positive allowing to hypothesize the direct implication of zinc ions in pathological aggregation of TDP-43.},

In vivo, cellular and extracellular spaces are occupied by a high volume fraction of macromolecules. The resulting macromolecular crowding energetically affects reactions. Amyloidogenesis can either be promoted by macromolecular crowding through the excluded volume effect or inhibited due to a viscosity increase reducing kinetics. Macromolecular crowding can be mimicked in vitro by the addition of non-specific polymers, e.g. Ficoll, dextran and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), the latter being rarely used to study amyloid systems. We investigated the effect of PVP on amyloidogenesis of full-length human islet amyloid polypeptide (involved in type II diabetes) using fibrillisation and surface activity assays, ELISA, immunoblot and microscale thermophoresis. We demonstrate that high molecular mass PVP360 promotes amyloidogenesis due to volume exclusion and increase in effective amyloidogenic monomer concentration, like other crowders, but without the confounding effects of viscosity and surface activity. Interestingly, we also show that low molecular mass PVP10 has unique inhibitory properties as inhibition of fibril elongation occurs mainly in the bulk solution and is due to PVP10 directly and strongly interacting with amyloid species rather than the increase in viscosity typically associated with macromolecular crowding. In vivo, amyloidogenesis might be affected by the properties and proximity of endogenous macromolecular crowders, which could contribute to changes in associated pathogenesis. More generally, the PVP10 molecular backbone could be used to design small compounds as potential inhibitors of toxic species formation.},

Understanding the mechanisms of their replication has important implications for global health and economic stability. Nonstructural protein 9 (nsp9) is an essential RNA binding protein for coronavirus replication. However, the mechanisms of the dimerization and nucleic acid binding of nsp9 remain elusive. Here, we report four crystal structures, including wild-type porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV) nsp9, PDCoV nsp9-$\Delta$N7 (N-terminal 7 amino acids deleted), wild-type porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) nsp9, and PEDV nsp9-C59A mutant. These structures reveal the diverse dimerization forms of coronavirus nsp9. We first found that the N-finger of nsp9 from PDCoV plays a critical role in dimerization. Meanwhile, PEDV nsp9 is distinguished by the presence of a disulfide bond in the dimer interface. Interestingly, size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation analyses indicate that the PDCoV nsp9-$\Delta$N7 and PEDV nsp9-C59A mutants are monomeric in solution. In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assays and microscale thermophoresis analysis indicate that the monomeric forms of PDCoV nsp9 and PEDV nsp9 still have nucleic acid binding affinity, although it is lower than that of the wild type. Our results show that the diverse dimerization forms of coronavirus nsp9 proteins enhance their nucleic acid binding affinity.},

In typical DECL selections, preferential binders are identified by high-throughput DNA sequencing, by comparing their frequency before and after the affinity capture step. Hits identified in this procedure need to be confirmed, by resynthesis and by performing affinity measurements. In this article we present new methods based on hybridization of oligonucleotide conjugates with fluorescently labeled complementary oligonucleotides; these facilitate the determination of affinity constants and kinetic dissociation constants. The experimental procedures were demonstrated with acetazolamide, a binder to carbonic anhydrase IX with a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range. The detection of binding events was compatible not only with fluorescence polarization methodologies, but also with Alphascreen technology and with microscale thermophoresis.},

abstract = {Cancers remain a threat to human health due to the lack of effective therapeutic strategies. Great effort has been devoted to the discovery of drug targets to treat cancers, but novel oncoproteins still need to be unveiled for efficient therapy. Methods: We show that CREPT is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer and is associated with poor disease-free survival. CREPT overexpression promotes but CREPT deletion blocks colony formation and proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells. To provide a proof of concept for CREPT as a new target for the inhibition of pancreatic cancer, we designed a cell-permeable peptide-based proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC), named PRTC, based on the homodimerized leucine-zipper-like motif in the C-terminus domain of CREPT to induce its degradation in vivo. Results: PRTC has high affinity for CREPT, with Kd = 0.34 +/- 0.11 $\mu$M and is able to permeate into cells because of the attached membrane-transportable peptide RRRRK. PRTC effectively induces CREPT degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. Intriguingly, PRTC inhibits colony formation, cell proliferation, and motility in pancreatic cancer cells and ultimately impairs xenograft tumor growth, comparable to the effect of CREPT deletion. Conclusions: PRTC-induced degradation of CREPT leads to inhibition of tumor growth, which is promising for the development of new drugs against pancreatic cancer. In addition, using an interacting motif based on the dimerized structure of proteins may be a new way to design a PROTAC aiming at degrading any protein without known interacting small molecules or peptides.},

abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies play an increasingly important role for the development of new drugs across multiple therapy areas. The term 'developability' encompasses the feasibility of molecules to successfully progress from discovery to development via evaluation of their physicochemical properties. These properties include the tendency for self-interaction and aggregation, thermal stability, colloidal stability, and optimization of their properties through sequence engineering. Selection of the best antibody molecule based on biological function, efficacy, safety, and developability allows for a streamlined and successful CMC phase. An efficient and practical high-throughput developability workflow (100 s-1,000 s of molecules) implemented during early antibody generation and screening is crucial to select the best lead candidates. This involves careful assessment of critical developability parameters, combined with binding affinity and biological properties evaluation using small amounts of purified material (<1 mg), as well as an efficient data management and database system. Herein, a panel of 152 various human or humanized monoclonal antibodies was analyzed in biophysical property assays. Correlations between assays for different sets of properties were established. We demonstrated in two case studies that physicochemical properties and key assay endpoints correlate with key downstream process parameters. The workflow allows the elimination of antibodies with suboptimal properties and a rank ordering of molecules for further evaluation early in the candidate selection process. This enables any further engineering for problematic sequence attributes without affecting program timelines.},

abstract = {Anthracyclines like daunorubicin (DRN) and doxorubicin (DOX) play an undisputed key role in cancer treatment, but their chronic administration can cause severe side effects. For precise anthracycline analytical systems, aptamers are preferable recognition elements. Here, we describe the detailed characterisation of a single-stranded DNA aptamer DRN-10 and its truncated versions for DOX and DRN detection. Binding affinities were determined from surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and microscale thermophoresis (MST) and combined with conformational data from circular dichroism (CD). Both aptamers displayed similar nanomolar binding affinities to DRN and DOX, even though their rate constants differed as shown by SPR recordings. SPR kinetic data unravelled a two-state reaction model including a 1:1 binding and a subsequent conformational change of the binding complex. This model was supported by CD spectra. In addition, the dissociation constants determined with MST were always lower than that from SPR, and especially for the truncated aptamer they differed by two orders of magnitude. This most probably reflects the methodological difference, namely labelling for MST vs. immobilisation for SPR. From CD recordings, we suggested a specific G-quadruplex as structural basis for anthracycline binding. We concluded that the aptamer DRN-10 is a promising recognition element for anthracycline detection systems and further selected aptamers can be also characterised with the combined methodological approach presented here.},

abstract = {Multivalent interactions at biological interfaces occur frequently in nature and mediate recognition and interactions in essential physiological processes such as cell-to-cell adhesion. Multivalency is also a key principle that allows tight binding between pathogens and host cells during the initial stages of infection. One promising approach to prevent infection is the design of synthetic or semisynthetic multivalent binders that interfere with pathogen adhesion1–4. Here, we present a multivalent binder that is based on a spatially defined arrangement of ligands for the viral spike protein haemagglutinin of the influenza A virus. Complementary experimental and theoretical approaches demonstrate that bacteriophage capsids, which carry host cell haemagglutinin ligands in an arrangement matching the geometry of binding sites of the spike protein, can bind to viruses in a defined multivalent mode. These capsids cover the entire virus envelope, thus preventing its binding to the host cell as visualized by cryo-electron tomography. As a consequence, virus infection can be inhibited in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Such highly functionalized capsids present an alternative to strategies that target virus entry by spike-inhibiting antibodies5 and peptides6 or that address late steps of the viral replication cycle7},

abstract = {Removing or preventing the formation of $\alpha$-synuclein aggregates is a plausible strategy against Parkinson's disease. To this end, we have engineered the $\beta$-wrapin AS69 to bind monomeric $\alpha$-synuclein with high affinity. In cultured cells, AS69 reduced the self-interaction of $\alpha$-synuclein and formation of visible $\alpha$-synuclein aggregates. In flies, AS69 reduced a-synuclein aggregates and the locomotor deficit resulting from $\alpha$-synuclein expression in neuronal cells. In biophysical experiments in vitro, AS69 highly sub-stoichiometrically inhibited both primary and autocatalytic secondary nucleation processes, even in the presence of a large excess of monomer. We present evidence that the AS69-$\alpha$-synuclein complex, rather than the free AS69, is the inhibitory species responsible for sub-stoichiometric inhibition of secondary nucleation. These results represent a new paradigm that high affinity monomer binders can lead to strongly substoichiometric inhibition of nucleation processes.},

abstract = {Several lines of evidence point to a compromised proteostasis associated with a reduction of the Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) activity in patients affected by Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and suggest that the amyloid $\beta$ peptide (A$\beta$) is an important player in the game. Inspired also by many reports, underlining the presence of ubiquitin (Ub) in the amyloid plaques of AD brains, here we set out to test whether Ub may bind the A$\beta$ peptide and have any effect on its clearance pathways. By using an integrated array of MALDI-TOF/UPLC-HRMS, fluorescence, NMR, SPR, Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) and molecular dynamics studies, we consistently demonstrated that A$\beta$40 binds Ub with a 1 : 1 stoichiometry and K d in the high micromolar range. In particular, we show that the N-terminal domain of the A$\beta$ peptide (through residues D1, E3 and R5) interacts with the C-terminal tail of Ub (involving residues K63 and E64), inducing the central region of A$\beta$ ( 14 HQKLVFFAEDVGSNK 28 ) to adopt a mixed $\alpha$-helix/$\beta$-turn structure. ELISA assays, carried out in neuroblastoma cell lysates, suggest that A$\beta$ competitively binds Ub also in the presence of the entire pool of cytosolic Ub binding proteins. Ub-bound A$\beta$ has a lower tendency to aggregate into amyloid-like fibrils and is more slowly degraded by the Insulin Degrading Enzyme (IDE). Finally, we observe that the water soluble fragment A$\beta$1-16 significantly inhibits Ub chain growth reactions. These results evidence how the non-covalent interaction between A$\beta$ peptides and Ub may have relevant effects on the regulation of the upstream events of the UPS and pave the way to future in vivo studies addressing the role played by A$\beta$ peptide in the malfunction of proteome maintenance occurring in AD.},

abstract = {The voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), found in the mitochondrial outer membrane, forms the main interface between mitochondrial and cellular metabolisms, mediates the passage of a variety of molecules across the mitochondrial outer membrane, and is central to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. VDAC1 is overexpressed in post-mortem brains of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. The development and progress of AD are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from the cytotoxic effects of accumulated amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$). In this study we demonstrate the involvement of VDAC1 and a VDAC1 N-terminal peptide (VDAC1-N-Ter) in A$\beta$ cell penetration and cell death induction. A$\beta$ directly interacted with VDAC1 and VDAC1-N-Ter, as monitored by VDAC1 channel conductance, surface plasmon resonance, and microscale thermophoresis. Preincubated A$\beta$ interacted with bilayer-reconstituted VDAC1 and increased its conductance $\beta$2-fold. Incubation of cells with A$\beta$ resulted in mitochondria-mediated apoptotic cell death. However, the presence of non-cell-penetrating VDAC1-N-Ter peptide preventedA$\beta$ cellular entry andA$\beta$-induced mitochondria- mediated apoptosis. Likewise, silencing VDAC1 expression by specific siRNA prevented A$\beta$ entry into the cytosol as well as A$\beta$-induced toxicity. Finally, the mode of A$\beta$-mediated action involves detachment of mitochondria-bound hexokinase, induction of VDAC1 oligomerization, and cytochrome c release, a sequence of events leading to apoptosis. As such, we suggest that A$\beta$-mediated toxicity involves mitochondrial and plasma membrane VDAC1, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis induction. The VDAC1-N-Ter peptide targeting A$\beta$ cytotoxicity is thus a potential new therapeutic strategy for AD treatment.},

Our models have been trained on therapeutic relevant proteins, including monoclonal antibodies, in various pharmaceutically relevant formulations. Further, we developed network architectures with good prediction power using the least amount of input features, i.e. experimental effort to train the network. This provides an empiric means to highlight the most important parameters in the prediction of real-time protein stability. Further, several models were developed by a different validation means (i.e. leave-one-protein-out cross-validation) to test the robustness and the limitations of our approach. Finally, we apply surrogate machine learning algorithms (e.g. linear regression) to build trust in the ANNs decision making procedure and to highlight the connection between the leading inputs and the outputs.},

abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, are characterized by increased protein aggregation in the brain, progressive neuronal loss, increased inflammation, and neurogenesis impairment. We analyzed the effects of a new purine derivative drug, PDD005, in attenuating mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, using both in vivo and in vitro models. We show that PDD005 is distributed to the brain and can rescue cognitive deficits associated with aging in mice. Treatment with PDD005 prevents impairment of neurogenesis by increasing sex-determining region Y-box 2, nestin, and also enhances synaptic function through upregulation of synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein 95. PDD005 treatment also reduced neuro-inflammation by decreasing interleukin-1$\beta$ expression, activation of astrocytes, and microglia. We identified prohibitin as a potential target in mediating the therapeutic effects of PDD005 for the treatment of cognitive deficit in aging mice. Additionally, in the current study, glycogen synthase kinase appears to attenuate tau pathology.},

abstract = {The human inducible phospho-fructokinase bisphosphatase isoform 3, PFKFB3, is a crucial regulatory node in the cellular metabolism. The enzyme is an important modulator regulating the intracellular fructose-2,6-bisphosphate level. PFKFB3 is a bifunctional enzyme with an exceptionally high kinase to phosphatase ratio around 740:1. Its kinase activity can be directly inhibited by small molecules acting directly on the kinase active site. On the other hand, here we propose an innovative and indirect strategy for the modulation of PFKFB3 activity, achieved through allosteric bisphosphatase activation. A library of small peptides targeting an allosteric site was discovered and synthesized. The binding affinity was evaluated by microscale thermophoresis (MST). Furthermore, a LC-MS/MS analytical method for assessing the bisphosphatase activity of PFKFB3 was developed. The new method was applied for measuring the activation on bisphosphatase activity with the PFKFB3-binding peptides. The molecular mechanical connection between the newly discovered allosteric site to the bisphosphatase activity was also investigated using both experimental and computational methods.},

To systematically determine molecular features that control its activity, here we analyze DNA-binding in vitro and genome-wide in vivo across different cell types with native or ectopic PU.1 expression. Although PU.1, in contrast to classical pioneer factors, is unable to access nucleosomal target sites in vitro, ectopic induction of PU.1 leads to the extensive remodeling of chromatin and redistribution of partner TFs. De novo chromatin access, stable binding, and redistribution of partner TFs both require PU.1's N-terminal acidic activation domain and its ability to recruit SWI/SNF remodeling complexes, suggesting that the latter may collect and distribute co-associated TFs in conjunction with the non-classical pioneer TF PU.1.},

abstract = {The calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cell (CN/NFAT) signaling pathway plays a critical role in the immune response. Therefore, inhibition of the CN/NFAT pathway is an important target for inflammatory disease. The conserved PxIxIT and LxVP motifs of CN substrates and targeting proteins have been recognized. Based on the affinity ability and inhibitory effect of these docking sequences on CN, we designed a bioactive peptide (named pep3) against the CN/NFAT interaction, which has two binding sites derived from the RCAN1-PxIxIT motif and the NFATc1-LxVP motif. The shortest linker between the two binding sites in pep3 is derived from A238L, a physiological binding partner of CN. Microscale thermophoresis (MST) revealed that pep3 has two docking sites on CN. Pep3 also has the most potent inhibitory effect on CN. It is suggested that pep3 contains an NFATc1-LxVP-substrate recognition motif and RCAN1-PxIxIT-mediated anchoring to CN. Expression of this peptide significantly suppresses CN/NFAT signaling. Cell-permeable 11-arginine-modified pep3 (11R-pep3) blocks the NFAT downstream signaling pathway. Intranasal administration of the 11R-pep3 peptide inhibits airway inflammation in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma model. Our results suggest that pep3 is promising as an immunosuppressive agent and can be used in topical remedies.},

They have multiple important functions including the regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1). The human isoforms CHP1 and CHP2 share high sequence similarity, but have distinct expression profiles with CHP2 levels for instance increased in malignant cells. These CHPs bind Ca2+ with high affinity. Biochemical data indicated that Ca2+ can regulate their functions. Experimental evidence for Ca2+-modulated structural changes was lacking. With a newly established fluorescent probe hydrophobicity (FPH) assay, we detected Ca2+-induced conformational changes in both CHPs. These changes are in line with an opening of their hydrophobic pocket that binds the CHP-binding region (CBD) of NHE1. Whereas the pocket is closed in the absence of Ca2+ in CHP2, it is still accessible for the dye in CHP1. Both CHPs interacted with CBD in the presence and absence of Ca2+. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis revealed high binding affinity for both CHPs to CBD with equilibrium dissociation constants (KDs) in the nanomolar range. The KD for CHP1:CBD was not affected by Ca2+, whereas Ca2+-depletion increased the KD 7-fold for CHP2:CBD showing a decreased affinity. The data indicate an isoform specific regulatory interaction of CHP1 and CHP2 with NHE1.},

However, virtually no information exists on the contribution of other HDAC6 domains on tubulin recognition. Here, using recombinant protein expression, site-directed mutagenesis, fluorimetric and biochemical assays, microscale thermophoresis, and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we identified the N-terminal, disordered region of HDAC6 as a microtubule-binding domain (MBD) and functionally characterized it to the single-molecule level. We show that the microtubule-binding motif spans two positively charged patches comprising residues Lys-32 to Lys-58. We found that HDAC6-microtubule interactions are entirely independent of the catalytic domains and are mediated by ionic interactions with the negatively charged microtubule surface. Importantly, a crosstalk between the MBD and the deacetylase domain was critical for recognition and efficient deacetylation of free tubulin dimers both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our results reveal that recognition of substrates by HDAC6 is more complex than previously appreciated, and that domains outside the tandem catalytic core are essential for proficient substrate deacetylation.},

abstract = {Efficient selection of nucleic acid aptamers with high affinity and specificity for a broad range of targets remains challenging. Historically, aptamer selections have been protracted and tedious processes, often requiring double-digit rounds of selection to converge nucleic acid pools into a small number of prospective high-affinity aptamers. More recently, the use of microfluidic devices and specialized equipment has helped streamline the aptamer selection process, but these platforms are not necessarily accessible to the broad research community. Here, we demonstrate that aptamers with high affinity and moderate specificity can be obtained with a conventional selection workflow that ismodified to include facilemethods for increasing partitioning and enhancing selection stringency. This process exposes an immobilized protein target to a single-stranded DNA library, followed by washing with buffer that contains the undesired off-target(s), with both steps occurring under constant perfusion using a standard peristaltic pump. Prospective aptamers are then eluted, amplified by an emulsion polymerase chain reaction, regenerated to single strands by enzymatic digestion, and resubjected to the selection procedure.We validated this selection scheme using the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family, wherebywe successfully isolated nanomolar affinity aptamers against PDGF-BB with specifi},

abstract = {Rationale: Nanomaterials capable of specifically interacting with proteins are very important for protein storage and vaccine delivery. Supramolecular hydrogels based on peptides have emerged as promising vaccine adjuvants because of their good compatibility, ease of antigen incorporation and display, and efficiency in activating immune responses. Methods: We synthesized a self-assembling peptide (Fbp-GDFDFDYDK($\gamma$E)2-NH2, Comp. 1) serving as a supramolecular protein chaperone for protein antigen delivery. The gelation was triggered by simply mixing Comp. 1 and proteins. The vaccine adjuvant potential of Comp. 1 was demonstrated by using two protein antigens, ovalbumin (OVA) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Results: The peptide derivative Comp. 1 exhibited high protein binding capacity. Upon contacting proteins, Comp. 1 rapidly formed coassembled nanofibers/hydrogels with the proteins, which greatly delayed the release of protein antigens. Our supramolecular protein chaperone significantly stimulated specific antibody titers by assisting protein delivery to antigen-presenting cells, promoting dendritic cell (DC) maturation, prolonging antigen accumulation and retention in the lymph nodes, and eliciting the secretion of cytokines. Most importantly, our supramolecular protein chaperone strongly stimulated the cellular immune response and significantly retarded tumor growth. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated the great potential of the supramolecular protein chaperone in protein storage and delivery, vaccine production and tumor immunotherapy.},

Titration experiments allowed us to evaluate the effects of actin-binding proteins (ABPs) on polymerization, including DNase I-induced inhibition and mDia2FH1FH2 (mDia2)-assisted acceleration of nucleation. The corresponding rates of actin filament elongation were quantitatively determined, yielding values in good agreement with those obtained using the pyrene-actin polymerization assay.

SDS22 has numerous diverse functions, surprisingly acting as both a PP1 inhibitor and as an activator. Here, we integrate cellular, biophysical, and crystallographic studies to address this conundrum. We discovered that SDS22 selectively binds a unique conformation of PP1 that contains a single metal (M2) at its active site, i.e., SDS22 traps metal-deficient inactive PP1. Furthermore, we showed that SDS22 dissociation is accompanied by a second metal (M1) being loaded into PP1, as free metal cannot dissociate the complex and M1-deficient mutants remain constitutively trapped by SDS22. Together, our findings reveal that M1 metal loading and loss are essential for PP1 regulation in cells, which has broad implications for PP1 maturation, activity, and holoenzyme subunit exchange.},

abstract = {Noncovalent interactions between biomolecules are critical to their activity. Native mass spectrometry (MS) has enabled characterization of these interactions by preserving noncovalent assemblies for mass analysis, including protein-ligand and protein-protein complexes for a wide range of soluble and membrane proteins. Recent advances in native MS of lipoprotein nanodiscs have also allowed characterization of antimicrobial peptides and membrane proteins embedded in intact lipid bilayers. However, conventional native electrospray ionization (ESI) can disrupt labile interactions. To stabilize macromolecular complexes for native MS, charge reducing reagents can be added to the solution prior to ESI, such as triethylamine, trimethylamine oxide, and imidazole. Lowering the charge acquired during ESI reduces Coulombic repulsion that leads to dissociation, and charge reduction reagents may also lower the internal energy of the ions through evaporative cooling. Here, we tested a range of imidazole derivatives to discover improved charge reducing reagents and to determine how their chemical properties influence charge reduction efficacy. We measured their effects on a soluble protein complex, a membrane protein complex in detergent, and lipoprotein nanodiscs with and without embedded peptides, and used computational chemistry to understand the observed charge-reduction behavior. Together, our data revealed that hydrophobic substituents at the 2 position on imidazole can significantly improve both charge reduction and gas-phase stability over existing reagents. These new imidazole derivatives will be immediately beneficial for a range of native MS applications and provide chemical principles to guide development of novel charge reducing reagents.},

abstract = {Very little is known about how Ser/Thr protein phosphatases specifically recruit and dephosphorylate substrates. Here, we identify how the Na+/H+-exchanger 1 (NHE1), a key regulator of cellular pH homeostasis, is regulated by the Ser/Thr phosphatase calcineurin (CN). NHE1 activity is increased by phosphorylation of NHE1 residue T779, which is specifically dephosphorylated by CN. While it is known that Ser/Thr protein phosphatases prefer pThr over pSer, we show that this preference is not key to this exquisite CN selectivity. Rather a combination of molecular mechanisms, including recognition motifs, dynamic charge-charge interactions and a substrate interaction pocket lead to selective dephosphorylation of pT779. Our data identify T779 as a site regulating NHE1-mediated cellular acid extrusion and provides a molecular understanding of NHE1 substrate selection by CN, specifically, and how phosphatases recruit specific substrates, generally.},

abstract = {SET and MYND domain-containing protein 3 (SMYD3) is a lysine methyltransferase that plays a central role in a variety of cancer diseases, exerting its pro-oncogenic activity by methylation of key proteins, of both nuclear and cytoplasmic nature. However, the role of SMYD3 in the initiation and progression of cancer is not yet fully understood and further biochemical characterization is required to support the discovery of therapeutics targeting this enzyme. We have therefore developed robust protocols for production, handling, and crystallization of SMYD3 and biophysical and biochemical assays for clarification of SMYD3 biochemistry and identification of useful lead compounds. Specifically, a time-resolved biosensor assay was developed for kinetic characterization of SMYD3 interactions. Functional differences in SMYD3 interactions with its natural small molecule ligands SAM and SAH were revealed, with SAM forming a very stable complex. A variety of peptides mimicking putative substrates of SMYD3 were explored in order to expose structural features important for recognition. The interaction between SMYD3 and some peptides was influenced by SAM. A nonradioactive SMYD3 activity assay using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis explored substrate features of importance also for methylation. Methylation was notable only toward MAP kinase kinase kinase 2 (MAP3K2_K260)-mimicking peptides, although binary and tertiary complexes were detected also with other peptides. The analysis supported a random bi-bi mechanistic model for SMYD3 methyltransferase catalysis. Our work unveiled complexities in SMYD3 biochemistry and resulted in procedures suitable for further studies and identification of novel starting points for design of effective and specific leads for this potential oncology target.},

abstract = {The Hippo signaling pathway controls cell–cell contact, cell proliferation, as well as organ size by integrating changes in the cellular microenvironment. In recent years, the pivotal role of Hippo signaling in cancers has been well recognized. Inhibition of the pathway promotes the translocation of the major Hippo pathway effectors, the yes-associated protein (YAP) and its paralog TAZ, to the nucleus, where they interact with the transcription factor family transcriptional enhancer associate domain (TEAD), thus coactivating the expression of downstream genes, leading to cell transformation, tissue overgrowth, and tumor development. Therefore, the interruption of the YAP–TEAD transcriptional complex represents a novel opportunity for the treatment of cancer. Here, we established a fluorescence polarization (FP)-based assay for the identification and evaluation of YAP–TEAD protein–protein interface (PPI) inhibitors at the YAP $\Omega$-loop binding region of TEAD, which is also called interface 3 at the YAP–TEAD binding surface. Furthermore, a patented small molecule (Patent-22) was evaluated by the FP assay, which confirmed that it was a YAP–TEAD PPI inhibitor at interface 3. Possessing great application value, this FP method is reliable, robust, and economical for inhibitor assessment and drug discovery.},

abstract = {Glucose homeostasis and growth essentially depend on the peptide hormone insulin engaging its receptor. Despite biochemical and structural advances, a fundamental contradiction has persisted in the current understanding of insulin ligand–receptor interactions. While biochemistry predicts two distinct insulin binding sites, 1 and 2, recent structural analyses have only resolved site 1. Using a combined approach of cryo-EM and atomistic molecular dynamics simulation, we determined the structure of the entire dimeric insulin receptor ectodomain saturated with four insulin molecules. Complementing the previously described insulin–site 1 interaction, we present the first view of insulin bound to the discrete insulin receptor site 2. Insulin binding stabilizes the receptor ectodomain in a T-shaped conformation wherein the membrane-proximal domains converge and contact each other. These findings expand the current models of insulin binding to its receptor and of its regulation. In summary, we provide the structural basis enabling a comprehensive description of ligand–receptor interactions that ultimately will inform new approaches to structure-based drug design. In brief A cryo-EM structure of the complete insulin receptor ectodomain saturated with four insulin ligands is reported. The structural model of the insulin–insulin receptor complex adopts a T-shaped conformation, reveals two additional insulin-binding sites potentially involved in the initial interaction of insulin with its receptor, and resolves the membrane proximal region.},

An emerging and straightforward method for studying molecular interactions is microscale thermophoresis (MST). This technique makes it possible to study interactions between miRNAs and various oligonucleotide inhibitors, independent of the chemical modifications of the inhibitors or their respective target structure, with very little sample volume required compared to competitive techniques, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Interaction studies between these inhibitors and their respective target structures were performed, and they allowed the assessment of binding characteristics and parameters, such as EC50 for a number of these inhibitors, with little effort. Furthermore, MST could be utilized for obtaining kinetic binding data of the Argonaute-2 protein with a miRNA, which showed a possible RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)-mediated turnover of inhibited miRNAs.},

abstract = {Methylation of the small ribosome subunit rRNA in the ribosomal decoding center results in exceptionally high-level aminoglycoside resistance in bacteria. Enzymes that methylate 16S rRNA on N7 of nucleotide G1405 (m7G1405) have been identified in both aminoglycoside-producing and clinically drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria. Using a fluorescence polarization 30S-binding assay and a new crystal structure of the methyltransferase RmtC at 3.14 {\AA} resolution, here we report a structure-guided functional study of 30S substrate recognition by the aminoglycoside resistance-associated 16S rRNA (m7G1405) methyltransferases. We found that the binding site for these enzymes in the 30S subunit directly overlaps with that of a second family of aminoglycoside resistance-associated 16S rRNA (m1A1408) methyltransferases, suggesting that both groups of enzymes may exploit the same conserved rRNA tertiary surface for docking to the 30S. Within RmtC, we defined an N-terminal domain surface, comprising basic residues from both the N1 and N2 subdomains, that directly contributes to 30S-binding affinity. In contrast, additional residues lining a contiguous adjacent surface on the C-terminal domain were critical for 16S rRNA modification but did not directly contribute to the binding affinity. The results from our experiments define the critical features of m7G1405 methyltransferase-substrate recognition and distinguish at least two distinct, functionally critical contributions of the tested enzyme residues: 30S-binding affinity and stabilizing a binding-induced 16S rRNA conformation necessary for G1405 modification. Our study sets the scene for future high-resolution structural studies of the 30S-methyltransferase complex and for potential exploitation of unique aspects of substrate recognition in future therapeutic strategies.},

Here, we have investigated the thermostability of an LPMO from Thermoascus aurantiacus (TaLPMO9A). TaLPMO9A was found to retain most of its initial activity after incubating at 100 °C while its apparent melting temperature (Tm) is 69 °C at neutral pH. Interestingly, our studies show that holoTaLPMO9A, apoTaLPMO9A and deglycosylated TaLPMO9A can fold back to their original conformation upon lowering the temperature. In the presence of $\beta$-mercaptoethanol the protein does not refold. Activity of TaLPMO9A and refolded TaLPMO9A was studied by an Amplex{\textregistered} Red assay as well as by TaLPMO9A catalysed oxidation of phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC). These studies confirm the functional regain of TaLPMO9A activity upon going through one cycle of unfolding and refolding. The thermal unfolding and refolding of TaLPMO9A was measured spectroscopically. Utilizing the two-state model, detailed thermodynamic parameters were obtained for holoTaLPMO. Furthermore, we have investigated the kinetics of TaLPMO9A unfolding and refolding. Our results have implications in understanding LPMO stability, which is crucial for the efficient application of LPMOs as biocatalysts during biomass degradation.},

The activity and stability of ADH in glyceline‐water mixtures using varying water contents were measured. Furthermore, the thermodynamic water activity and viscosity of glyceline‐water mixtures have been determined. For a better understanding of the observations molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to quantify ADH's molecular flexibility, hydration layer, and intra‐protein hydrogen bonds. The behavior of the enzyme in DES follows the classic dependence of water activity (aW) in non‐conventional media. At low aW values (< 0.2) ADH does not show any activity, at higher aW values the activity was still lower than in pure water due to the high viscosities of the DES. These findings could be further explained by an increased enzyme flexibility with increased water content.},

High expression levels were observed in E. coli using the pETDuet-1 plasmid system in combination with an autoinduction protocol. A broad substrate scope ranging from aromatic to aliphatic carboxylic acids was tested and TtCAR showed activity for all substrates. High specific activities for aromatic substrates and short chain aliphatic substrates were observed, comparable to those of NcCAR, the first type III fungal CAR. TtCAR's pH and temperature optima were at 6.5 and 30 °C, respectively. Up to 20% (v/v) cosolvents did not show a decrease in specific activity of TtCAR using (E)-cinnamic acid as a substrate. Its half-life at 40 °C was determined to be 8.25 h and its melting temperature (Tm) was 56 °C. In vitro reactions with TtCAR reduced 95.2% of 10 mM vanillic acid, which correlated to a titer of 1.4 g L−1 of vanillin. The space time yield of 0.029 g L-1 h-1 indicates that further improvements would be necessary for an industrially relevant application. This would be especially important when competing against de novo synthesis of bio vanillin by microbial strains producing > 30 g L-1. In de novo and in vivo biosynthesis systems, by-products are fairly common. By contrast, we were pleased to observe less than 0.7% of vanillyl alcohol formed, making the cell-free acid reduction in the envisaged sequential two-step bioconversion from eugenol to vanillin very attractive.},

In this work, we present a structure-based approach to discover new molecules that successfully reduce the aggregation of proteins and apply the approach to the model protein Interferon-alpha-2a.},

abstract = {TRPM8 is a member of the transient receptor potential ion channel family where it functions as a cold and pain sensor in humans and other higher organisms. Previous studies show that TRPM8 requires the signaling phosphoinositide lipid PIP2 to function. TRPM8 function is further regulated by other diverse mechanisms, including the small modulatory membrane protein PIRT (phosphoinositide regulator of TRP). Like TRPM8, PIRT also binds PIP2 and behavioral studies have shown that PIRT is required for normal TRPM8-mediated cold-sensing. To better understand the molecular mechanism of PIRT regulation of TRPM8, solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to assign the backbone resonances of full-length human PIRT and investigate the direct binding of PIRT to PIP2 and the human TRPM8 S1-S4 transmembrane domain. Microscale thermophoresis (MST) binding studies validate the NMR results and identify a competitive PIRT interaction between PIP2 and the TRPM8 S1-S4 domain. Computational PIP2 docking to a human TRPM8 comparative model was performed to help localize where PIRT may bind TRPM8. Taken together, our data suggest a mechanism where TRPM8, PIRT, and PIP2 form a regulatory complex and PIRT modulation of TRPM8 arises, at least in part, by regulating local concentrations of PIP2 accessible to TRPM8.},

abstract = {Abstract Amyloid $\beta$-peptides (A$\beta$) play a major role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, numerous monoclonal antibodies against A$\beta$ have been developed for basic and clinical research. The present study applied fluorescence based analytical ultracentrifugation and microscale thermophoresis to characterize the interaction between A$\beta$42 monomers and three popular, commercially available antibodies, namely 6E10, 4G8 and 12F4. Both methods allowed us to analyze the interactions at low nanomolar concentrations of analytes close to their dissociation constants (KD) as required for the study of high affinity interactions. Furthermore, the low concentrations minimized the unwanted self-aggregation of A$\beta$. Our study demonstrates that all three antibodies bind to A$\beta$42 monomers with comparable affinities in the low nanomolar range. KD values for A$\beta$42 binding to 6E10 and 4G8 are in good agreement with formerly reported values from SPR studies, while the KD for 12F4 binding to A$\beta$42 monomer is reported for the first time.},

abstract = {Serpin protease inhibitors and $\beta$-amylase starch hydrolases are very abundant seed proteins in the endosperm of grasses. $\beta$-amylase is a crucial enzyme in the beer industry providing maltose for fermenting yeast. In animals and plants, inhibitory serpins form covalent linkages that inactivate their cognate proteases. Additionally, in animals, noninhibitory functions for serpins are observed such as metabolite carriers and chaperones. The function of serpins in seeds has yet to be unveiled. In developing endosperm, serpin Z4 and $\beta$-amylase showed similar in vivo spatio-temporal accumulation properties and colocalize in the cytosol of transformed tobacco leaves. A molecular interaction between recombinant proteins of serpin Z4 and $\beta$-amylase was revealed by surface plasmon resonance and microscale thermophoresis yielding a dissociation constant of 10-7 M. Importantly, the addition of serpin Z4 significantly changes $\beta$-amylase enzymatic properties by increasing its maximal catalytic velocity. The presence of serpin Z4 stabilizes $\beta$-amylase activity during heat treatment without affecting its critical denaturing temperature. Oxidative stress, simulated by the addition of CuCl2, leads to the formation of high molecular weight polymers of $\beta$-amylase similar to those detected in vivo. The polymers were cross-linked through disulfide bonds, the formation of which was repressed when serpin Z4 was present. The results suggest an unprecedented function for a plant seed serpin as a $\beta$-amylase-specific chaperone-like partner that could optimize $\beta$-amylase activity upon germination. This report is the first to describe a noninhibitory function for a serpin in plants.},

The receptor responsible for succinate signalling, SUCNR1 (also known as GPR91), is a member of the G-protein-coupled-receptor family2 and links succinate signalling to renin-induced hypertension, retinal angiogenesis and inflammation3–5. Because SUCNR1 senses succinate as an immunological danger signal6—which has relevance for diseases including ulcerative colitis, liver fibrosis7, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis3,8—it is of interest as a therapeutic target. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of rat SUCNR1 in complex with an intracellular binding nanobody in the inactive conformation. Structure-based mutagenesis and radioligand-binding studies, in conjunction with molecular modelling, identified key residues for speciesselective antagonist binding and enabled the determination of the high-resolution crystal structure of a humanized rat SUCNR1 in complex with a high-affinity, humanselective antagonist denoted NF-56-EJ40. We anticipate that these structural insights into the architecture of the succinate receptor and its antagonist selectivity will enable structure-based drug discovery and will further help to elucidate the function of SUCNR1 in vitro and in vivo.},

Furthermore, VEGF is involved in the development and growth of cancer and other diseases like agerelated macular degeneration, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, and neurodegenerative disorders. Detecting the protein biomarker VEGF is therefore of great importance for medical research and diagnostics. In this research, VEGFbinding aptamers were investigated for the systematic development of a targetinduced dissociation (TID) assay utilizing thermophoresis and microarrays. The established aptamer-microarray allowed for the detection of 0.1 nM of VEGF.

We utilized microscale thermophoresis technique to determine the amine-binding properties of YRPs in saliva of Phlebotomus perniciosus and P. orientalis, the Old-World vectors of visceral leishmaniases causative agents. Expressed and purified YRPs from three different sand fly species were tested for their interactions with various biogenic amines, including serotonin, histamine and catecholamines. Using the L. longipalpis YRP LJM11 as a control, we have demonstrated the comparability of the microscale thermophoresis method with conventional isothermal titration calorimetry described previously. By homology in silico modeling, we predicted the surface charge and both amino acids and hydrogen bonds of the amine-binding motifs to influence the binding affinities between closely related YRPs. All YRPs tested bound at least two biogenic amines, while the affinities differ both among and within species. Low affinity was observed for histamine. The salivary recombinant proteins rSP03B (P. perniciosus) and rPorASP4 (P. orientalis) showed high-affinity binding of serotonin, suggesting their capability to facilitate inhibition of the blood vessel contraction and platelet aggregation.},

abstract = {Protein import of nuclear- encoded proteins into plant chloroplasts is a highly regulated process, requiring fine-tuning mechanisms especially during chloroplast differentiation. One way of altering the import efficiency is achieved by phosphorylation of chloroplast transit peptides in the cytosol. Recently, we have investigated the role of three serine/threonine/tyrosine (STY) kinases, STY8, STY17, and STY46, in precursor phosphorylation. These three kinases share a high degree of similarity and harbor a conserved ACT domain upstream of the kinase domain. The ACT domain is a widely distributed structural motif, known to be important for the allosteric regulation of many enzymes. In this work, using biochemical and biophysical techniques both in vitro and in planta, including kinase assays, microscale thermophoresis, size-exclusion chromatography, as well as site-directed mutagenesis approaches, we show that the ACT domain regulates autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation of the STY kinases. We found that isoleucine and S-adenosylmethionine bind to the ACT domain, negatively influencing its autophosphorylation ability. Moreover, we investigated the role of the ACT domain in planta and confirmed its involvement in chloroplast differentiation in vivo. Our results provide detailed insights into the regulation of enzyme activity by ACT domains and establish that it has a role in binding amino acid ligands during chloroplast biogenesis.},

Accordingly, knowledge of MUC5B structure and its interactions with itself and other proteins is critical to better understand airway mucus biology and improve the management of lung diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The role of an N-terminal multimerization domain in the supramolecular organization of MUC5B has been previously described, but less is known about its C-terminal dimerization domain. Here, using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analyses of recombinant disulfide-linked dimeric MUC5B dimerization domain we identified an asymmetric, elongated twisted structure, with a double globular base. We found that the dimerization domain is more resistant to disruption than the multimerization domain suggesting the twisted structure of the dimerization domain confers additional stability to MUC5B polymers. Size-exclusion chromatography-multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS), SPR-based biophysical analyses and microscale thermophoresis of the dimerization domain disclosed no further assembly, but did reveal reversible, calcium-dependent interactions between the dimerization and multimerization domains that were most active at acidic pH, suggesting that these domains have a role in MUC5B intragranular organization. In summary, our results suggest a role for the C-terminal dimerization domain of MUC5B in compaction of mucin chains during granular packaging via interactions with the N-terminal multimerization domain. Our findings further suggest that the less stable multimerization domain provides a potential target for mucin depolymerization to remove mucus plugs in COPD and other lung pathologies.},

abstract = {Pandemic HIV-1 (group M) emerged following the cross-species transmission of a simian immunodeficiency virus from chimpanzees (SIVcpz) to humans. Primate lentiviruses (HIV/SIV) require the T cell receptor CD4 to enter into target cells. By surveying the sequence and function of CD4 in 50 chimpanzee individuals, we find that all chimpanzee CD4 alleles encode a fixed, chimpanzee-specific substitution (34T) that creates a glycosylation site on the virus binding surface of the CD4 receptor. Additionally, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has arisen in chimpanzee CD4 (68T) that creates a second glycosylation site on the same virus-binding interface. This substitution is not yet fixed, but instead alleles containing this SNP are still circulating within chimpanzee populations. Thus, all allelic versions of chimpanzee CD4 are singly glycosylated at the virus binding surface, and some allelic versions are doubly glycosylated. Doubly glycosylated forms of chimpanzee CD4 reduce HIV-1 and SIVcpz infection by as much as two orders of magnitude. Full restoration of virus infection in cells bearing chimpanzee CD4 requires reversion of both threonines at sites 34 and 68, destroying both of the glycosylation sites, suggesting that the effects of the glycans are additive. Differentially glycosylated CD4 receptors were biochemically purified and used in neutralization assays and microscale thermophoresis to show that the glycans on chimpanzee CD4 reduce binding affinity with the lentiviral surface glycoprotein, Env. These glycans create a shield that protects CD4 from being engaged by viruses, demonstrating a powerful form of host resistance against deadly primate lentiviruses.},

It was of interest to determine if DSF could be used with membrane proteins in the lipid cubic phase (LCP), which increasingly is being used for crystallization in support of structure–function studies.

We identified known and novel binders and characterized selected interactions through microscale thermophoresis, isothermal titra-tion calorimetry, and NMR. We uncover site-specific phospho-regulation of PDZ domain interactions, provide a structural framework for how PDZ domains accomplish phosphopeptide binding, and discuss ligand phosphorylation as a switching mechanism of PDZ domain interactions.

abstract = {In order to survive and persist in an immunocompetent human host, Borrelia burgdorferi controls the human immune attack and blocks the damaging effects of the activated complement system. These Gram-negative spirochetes use CspA (CRASP-1) and four additional immune evasion proteins to bind combinations of human plasma regulators, including factor H, factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1), complement factor H-related protein 1 (CFHR1), CFHR2, CFHR5, and plasminogen. As many microbial immune evasion proteins have multiple functions, we hypothesized that CspA has additional roles in complement or immune control. Here, we identify CspA as a terminal complement inhibitor. Borrelial CspA binds the human terminal complement components C7 and C9 and blocks assembly and membrane insertion of the terminal complement complex (TCC). CspA inhibits TCC assembly at the level of C7, as revealed by hemolytic assays, and inhibits polymerization of C9. CspA, when ectopically expressed on the surface of serum-sensitive Borrelia garinii, blocks TCC assembly on the level of C7 and induces serum resistance in the transformed bacteria. This CspA-mediated serum resistance and terminal complement pathway inhibition allow B. burgdorferi to survive in the hostile environment of human plasma.IMPORTANCE The present study defines a new mechanism by which the pathogenic bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi controls the terminal complement pathway of the human host to survive in human serum. The borrelial CspA binds to terminal pathway proteins C7 and C9 and inhibits the terminal complement pathway at the step of C7 and thereby inhibits terminal complement complex (TCC) assembly and membrane insertion. CspA blocks TCC assembly and insertion when expressed at the bacterial surface. CspA is the first TCC inhibitor cloned and functionally characterized from a Gram-negative bacterium. This identification of a bacterial TCC inhibitor of pathogen origin expands our knowledge of complement evasion of pathogenic bacteria and shows that pathogenic bacteria target the terminal pathway of complement. Thus, CspA as a central microbial virulence factor can represent an interesting biomarker and a target to develop new therapeutics and vaccines against borreliae.},

abstract = {The spindle checkpoint of the cell division cycle senses kinetochores that are not attached to microtubules and prevents precocious onset of anaphase, which can lead to aneuploidy. The nuclear division cycle 80 complex (Ndc80C) is a major microtubule receptor at the kinetochore. Ndc80C also mediates the kinetochore recruitment of checkpoint proteins. We found that the checkpoint protein kinase monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1) directly bound to Ndc80C through two independent interactions. Both interactions involved the microtubule-binding surfaces of Ndc80C and were directly inhibited in the presence of microtubules. Elimination of one such interaction in human cells caused checkpoint defects expected from a failure to detect unattached kinetochores. Competition between Mps1 and microtubules for Ndc80C binding thus constitutes a direct mechanism for the detection of unattached kinetochores.},

Phox-I1 binds to p67(phox) with a submicromolar affinity and abrogates Rac1 binding and is effective in inhibiting NOX2-mediated superoxide production dose-dependently in human and murine neutrophils without detectable toxicity. Medicinal chemistry characterizations have yielded promising analogs and initial information of the structure-activity relationship of Phox-I1. Our studies suggest the potential utility of Phox-I class inhibitors in NOX2 oxidase inhibition and present an application of rational targeting of a small GTPase-effector interface.},

abstract = {RNase P is a universal enzyme that removes 5' leader sequences from tRNA precursors. The enzyme is therefore essential for maturation of functional tRNAs and mRNA translation. RNase P represents a unique example of an enzyme that can occur either as ribonucleoprotein or as protein alone. The latter form of the enzyme, called protein-only RNase P (PRORP), is widespread in eukaryotes in which it can provide organellar or nuclear RNase P activities. Here, we have focused on Arabidopsis nuclear PRORP2 and its interaction with tRNA substrates. Affinity measurements helped assess the respective importance of individual pentatricopeptide repeat motifs in PRORP2 for RNA binding. We characterized the PRORP2 structure by X-ray crystallography and by small-angle X-ray scattering in solution as well as that of its complex with a tRNA precursor by small-angle X-ray scattering. Of note, our study reports the first structural data of a PRORP-tRNA complex. Combined with complementary biochemical and biophysical analyses, our structural data suggest that PRORP2 undergoes conformational changes to accommodate its substrate. In particular, the catalytic domain and the RNA-binding domain can move around a central hinge. Altogether, this work provides a refined model of the PRORP-tRNA complex that illustrates how protein-only RNase P enzymes specifically bind tRNA and highlights the contribution of protein dynamics to achieve this specific interaction.},

Characterization using size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering confirmed conjugation and the increase in molecular size, while Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that the secondary structure of the conjugate was not affected by coupling. Meanwhile, microcalorimetry and aggregation studies showed a significant increase in protein stability. Surface plasmon resonance and microscale thermopho- resis showed that the conjugate retained its nanomolar affinity, and finally, the pharmacokinetics of the HESylated protein exhibited a 6.5-fold increase in the half-life, and a 45-fold increase in the AUC.

abstract = {The nuclear envelope is a double membrane that separates the nucleus from the cytoplasm. The inner nuclear membrane (INM) functions in essential nuclear processes including chromatin organization and regulation of gene expression. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum and is the site of membrane protein synthesis. Protein homeostasis in this compartment is ensured by endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathways that in yeast involve the integral membrane E3 ubiquitin ligases Hrd1 and Doa10 operating with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc6 and Ubc7 (refs 2, 3). However, little is known about protein quality control at the INM. Here we describe a protein degradation pathway at the INM in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mediated by the Asi complex consisting of the RING domain proteins Asi1 and Asi3 (ref. 4). We report that the Asi complex functions together with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc6 and Ubc7 to degrade soluble and integral membrane proteins. Genetic evidence suggests that the Asi ubiquitin ligase defines a pathway distinct from, but complementary to, ERAD. Using unbiased screening with a novel genome-wide yeast library based on a tandem fluorescent protein timer, we identify more than 50 substrates of the Asi, Hrd1 and Doa10 E3 ubiquitin ligases. We show that the Asi ubiquitin ligase is involved in degradation of mislocalized integral membrane proteins, thus acting to maintain and safeguard the identity of the INM.},

A factor responsible for their establishment is the SCHENGEN3/GASSHO1 (SGN3/GSO1) receptor-like kinase. Its loss of function causes discontinuous Casparian strips. SGN3 also mediates endodermal overlignification of other Casparian strip mutants. Yet, without ligand, SGN3 function remained elusive. Here we report that schengen2 (sgn2) is defective in an enzyme sulfating peptide ligands. On the basis of this observation, we identified two stele-expressed peptides (CASPARIAN STRIP INTEGRITY FACTORS, CIF1/2) that complement sgn2 at nanomolar concentrations and induce Casparian strip mislocalization as well as overlignification-all of which depend on SGN3. Direct peptide binding to recombinant SGN3 identifies these peptides as SGN3 ligands. We speculate that CIF1/2-SGN3 is part of a barrier surveillance system, evolved to guarantee effective sealing of the supracellular Casparian strip network.},

Grb2 plays a pivotal role in tyrosine kinase-mediated signal transduction including linking receptor tyrosine kinases to the Ras/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, which is implicated in oncogenic outcome. Grb2 exists in a constitutive equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric states. Here we show that only monomeric Grb2 is capable of binding to SOS and upregulating MAP kinase signalling and that the dimeric state is inhibitory to this process. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 160 (Y160) on Grb2, or binding of a tyrosylphosphate-containing ligand to the SH2 domain of Grb2, results in dimer dissociation. Phosphorylation of Y160 on Grb2 is readily detectable in the malignant forms of human prostate, colon and breast cancers. The self-association/dissociation of Grb2 represents a switch that regulates MAP kinase activity and hence controls cancer progression.},

abstract = {Lysosomes respond to environmental cues by controlling their own biogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we describe a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent and mTORC1-independent mechanism for regulating lysosome biogenesis, which provides insights into previously reported effects of PKC on lysosomes. By identifying lysosome-inducing compounds we show that PKC couples activation of the TFEB transcription factor with inactivation of the ZKSCAN3 transcriptional repressor through two parallel signalling cascades. Activated PKC inactivates GSK3beta, leading to reduced phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and activation of TFEB, while PKC activates JNK and p38 MAPK, which phosphorylate ZKSCAN3, leading to its inactivation by translocation out of the nucleus. PKC activation may therefore mediate lysosomal adaptation to many extracellular cues. PKC activators facilitate clearance of aggregated proteins and lipid droplets in cell models and ameliorate amyloid beta plaque formation in APP/PS1 mouse brains. Thus, PKC activators are viable treatment options for lysosome-related disorders.},

abstract = {An aptamer was previously selected against the anaphylactic allergen $\beta$-conglutin ($\beta$-CBA I), which was subsequently truncated to an 11-mer and the affinity improved by two orders of magnitude. The work reported here details the selection and characterisation of a second aptamer ($\beta$-CBA II) selected against a second aptatope on the $\beta$-conglutin target. The affinity of this second aptamer was similar to that of the 11-mer, and its affinity was confirmed by three different techniques at three independent laboratories. This $\beta$-CBA II aptamer in combination with the previously selected $\beta$-CBA I was then exploited to a dual-aptamer approach. The specific and simultaneous binding of the dual aptamer ($\beta$-CBA I and $\beta$-CBA II) to different sites of $\beta$-conglutin was confirmed using both microscale thermophoresis and surface plasmon resonance where $\beta$-CBA II serves as the primary capturing aptamer and $\beta$-CBA I or the truncated $\beta$-CBA I (11-mer) as the secondary signalling aptamer, which can be further exploited in enzyme-linked aptamer assays and aptasensors.},

abstract = {Ras pathway signaling plays a critical role in cell growth control and is often upregulated in human cancer. The Raf kinases selectively interact with GTP-bound Ras and are important effectors of Ras signaling, functioning as the initiating kinases in the ERK cascade. Here, we identify a route for the phospho-inhibition of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway signaling that is mediated by the stress-activated JNK cascade. We find that key Ras pathway components, the RasGEF Sos1 and the Rafs, are phosphorylated on multiple S/TP sites in response to JNK activation and that the hyperphosphorylation of these sites renders the Rafs and Sos1 unresponsive to upstream signals. This phospho-regulatory circuit is engaged by cancer therapeutics, such as rigosertib and paclitaxel/Taxol, that activate JNK through mitotic and oxidative stress as well as by physiological regulators of the JNK cascade and may function as a signaling checkpoint to suppress the Ras pathway during conditions of cellular stress.},

abstract = {Cell-surface-receptor binding by influenza viruses is a key determinant of their transmissibility, both from avian and animal species to humans as well as from human to human. Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses that are a threat to public health have been observed to acquire affinity for human receptors, and transmissible-mutant-selection experiments have identified a virus that is transmissible in ferrets, the generally accepted experimental model for influenza in humans. Here, our quantitative biophysical measurements of the receptor-binding properties of haemagglutinin (HA) from the transmissible mutant indicate a small increase in affinity for human receptor and a marked decrease in affinity for avian receptor. From analysis of virus and HA binding data we have derived an algorithm that predicts virus avidity from the affinity of individual HA-receptor interactions. It reveals that the transmissible-mutant virus has a 200-fold preference for binding human over avian receptors. The crystal structure of the transmissible-mutant HA in complex with receptor analogues shows that it has acquired the ability to bind human receptor in the same folded-back conformation as seen for HA from the 1918, 1957 (ref. 4), 1968 (ref. 5) and 2009 (ref. 6) pandemic viruses. This binding mode is substantially different from that by which non-transmissible wild-type H5 virus HA binds human receptor. The structure of the complex also explains how the change in preference from avian to human receptors arises from the Gln226Leu substitution, which facilitates binding to human receptor but restricts binding to avian receptor. Both features probably contribute to the acquisition of transmissibility by this mutant virus.},

abstract = {Calmodulin (CaM) functions depend on interactions with CaM-binding proteins, regulated by Ca2+. Induced structural changes influence the affinity, kinetics, and specificities of the interactions. The dynamics of CaM interactions with neurogranin (Ng) and the CaM-binding region of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII290-309 ) have been studied using biophysical methods. These proteins have opposite Ca2+ dependencies for CaM binding. Surface plasmon resonance biosensor analysis confirmed that Ca2+ and CaM interact very rapidly, and with moderate affinity ( KDSPR=3$\mu$M). Calmodulin-CaMKII290-309 interactions were only detected in the presence of Ca2+, exhibiting fast kinetics and nanomolar affinity ( KDSPR=7.1nM). The CaM-Ng interaction had higher affinity under Ca2+-depleted ( KDSPR=480nM,k1=3.4×105M-1s-1 and k-1 = 1.6 × 10-1 s-1 ) than Ca2+-saturated conditions ( KDSPR=19$\mu$M). The IQ motif of Ng (Ng27-50 ) had similar affinity for CaM as Ng under Ca2+-saturated conditions ( KDSPR=14$\mu$M), but no interaction was seen under Ca2+-depleted conditions. Microscale thermophoresis using fluorescently labeled CaM confirmed the surface plasmon resonance results qualitatively, but estimated lower affinities for the Ng ( KDMST=890nM) and CaMKII290-309 ( KDMST=190nM) interactions. Although CaMKII290-309 showed expected interaction characteristics, they may be different for full-length CaMKII. The data for full-length Ng, but not Ng27-50 , agree with the current model on Ng regulation of Ca2+/CaM signaling.},

Rhosin contains two aromatic rings tethered by a linker, and it binds to the surface area sandwiching Trp58 of RhoA with a submicromolar Kd and effectively inhibits GEF-catalyzed RhoA activation. In cells, Rhosin specifically inhibited RhoA activity and RhoA-mediated cellular function without affecting Cdc42 or Rac1 signaling activities. By suppressing RhoA or RhoC activity, Rhosin could inhibit mammary sphere formation by breast cancer cells, suppress invasion of mammary epithelial cells, and induce neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells in synergy with NGF. Thus, the rational designed RhoA subfamily-specific small molecule inhibitor is useful for studying the physiological and pathologic roles of Rho GTPase.},

abstract = {Pectin methylesterases (PMEs) catalyze the demethylesterification of homogalacturonan domains of pectin in plant cell walls and are regulated by endogenous pectin methylesterase inhibitors (PMEIs). In Arabidopsis dark-grown hypocotyls, one PME (AtPME3) and one PMEI (AtPMEI7) were identified as potential interacting proteins. Using RT-qPCR analysis and gene promoter::GUS fusions, we first showed that AtPME3 and AtPMEI7 genes had overlapping patterns of expression in etiolated hypocotyls. The two proteins were identified in hypocotyl cell wall extracts by proteomics. To investigate the potential interaction between AtPME3 and AtPMEI7, both proteins were expressed in a heterologous system and purified by affinity chromatography. The activity of recombinant AtPME3 was characterized on homogalacturonans (HGs) with distinct degrees (DM)/patterns of methylesterification. AtPME3 showed the highest activity at pH 7.5 on HG substrates with a DM between 60% and 80% and a random distribution of methyl esters. On the best HG substrate, AtPME3 generates long non-methylesterified stretches and leaves short highly methylesterified zones indicating that it acts as a processive enzyme. The recombinant AtPMEI7 and AtPME3 interaction reduces the level of demethylesterification of the HG substrate but does not inhibit the processivity of the enzyme. These data suggest that the AtPME3/AtPMEI7 complex is not covalently linked and could, depending on the pH, be alternately formed and dissociated. Docking analysis indicated that the inhibition of AtPME3 could occur via the interaction of AtPMEI7 with a PME ligand-binding cleft structure. All these data indicate that AtPME3 and AtPMEI7 could be partners involved in the fine-tuning of HG methylesterification during plant development.},

abstract = {Calcium (Ca(2+)) and redox signalling play important roles in acclimation processes from archaea to eukaryotic organisms. Herein we characterized a unique protein from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that has the competence to integrate Ca(2+)- and redox-related signalling. This protein, designated as calredoxin (CRX), combines four Ca(2+)-binding EF-hands and a thioredoxin (TRX) domain. A crystal structure of CRX, at 1.6 {\AA} resolution, revealed an unusual calmodulin-fold of the Ca(2+)-binding EF-hands, which is functionally linked via an inter-domain communication path with the enzymatically active TRX domain. CRX is chloroplast-localized and interacted with a chloroplast 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (PRX1). Ca(2+)-binding to CRX is critical for its TRX activity and for efficient binding and reduction of PRX1. Thereby, CRX represents a new class of Ca(2+)-dependent 'sensor-responder' proteins. Genetically engineered Chlamydomonas strains with strongly diminished amounts of CRX revealed altered photosynthetic electron transfer and were affected in oxidative stress response underpinning a function of CRX in stress acclimation.},

abstract = {Oncogenic mutations of the Wnt (wingless)/beta-catenin pathway are frequently observed in major cancer types. Thus far, however, no therapeutic agent targeting Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is available for clinical use. Here we demonstrate that axitinib, a clinically approved drug, strikingly blocks Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in cancer cells, zebrafish, and Apc(min/+) mice. Notably, axitinib dramatically induces Wnt asymmetry and nonrandom DNA segregation in cancer cells by promoting nuclear beta-catenin degradation independent of the GSK3beta (glycogen synthase kinase3beta)/APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) complex. Using a DARTS (drug affinity-responsive target stability) assay coupled to 2D-DIGE (2D difference in gel electrophoresis) and mass spectrometry, we have identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase SHPRH (SNF2, histone-linker, PHD and RING finger domain-containing helicase) as the direct target of axitinib in blocking Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Treatment with axitinib stabilizes SHPRH and thereby increases the ubiquitination and degradation of beta-catenin. Our findings suggest a previously unreported mechanism of nuclear beta-catenin regulation and indicate that axitinib, a clinically approved drug, would provide therapeutic benefits for cancer patients with aberrant nuclear beta-catenin activation.},

abstract = {Protein aggregation remains a major area of focus in the production of monoclonal antibodies. Improving the intrinsic properties of antibodies can improve manufacturability, attrition rates, safety, formulation, titers, immunogenicity, and solubility. Here, we explore the potential of predicting and reducing the aggregation propensity of monoclonal antibodies, based on the identification of aggregation-prone regions and their contribution to the thermodynamic stability of the protein. Although aggregation-prone regions are thought to occur in the antigen binding region to drive hydrophobic binding with antigen, we were able to rationally design variants that display a marked decrease in aggregation propensity while retaining antigen binding through the introduction of artificial aggregation gatekeeper residues. The reduction in aggregation propensity was accompanied by an increase in expression titer, showing that reducing protein aggregation is beneficial throughout the development process. The data presented show that this approach can significantly reduce liabilities in novel therapeutic antibodies and proteins, leading to a more efficient path to clinical studies.},

abstract = {The Parkinson's-associated protein, DJ-1, is a highly conserved homodimer, ubiquitously expressed in cells. Here we demonstrate that DJ-1 is a 20S proteasome regulator. We show that DJ-1 physically binds the 20S proteasome and inhibits its activity, rescuing partially unfolded proteins from degradation. Consequently, DJ-1 stabilizes the cellular levels of 20S proteasome substrates, as we show for alpha-synuclein and p53. Furthermore, we demonstrate that following oxidative stress, DJ-1 is involved in the Nrf2-dependent oxidative stress response that leads to the upregulation of both the 20S proteasome and its regulator, NQO1. Overall, our results suggest a regulatory circuit in which DJ-1, under conditions of oxidative stress, both upregulates and inhibits the 20S proteasome, providing a rigorous control mechanism at a time when the 20S proteasome becomes the major proteolytic machinery. Such a tight regulation of the 20S proteasome may sustain the balance between the need to rapidly eliminate oxidatively damaged proteins and maintain the abundance of native, intrinsically unstructured proteins, which coordinate regulatory and signalling events.},

abstract = {Chemical modification of proteins provides great opportunities to control and visualize living systems. The most common way to modify proteins is reaction of their abundant amines with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters. Here we explore the impact of amine number and positioning on protein-conjugate behavior using streptavidin-biotin, a central research tool. Dye-NHS modification of streptavidin severely damaged ligand binding, necessitating development of a new streptavidin-retaining ultrastable binding after labeling. Exploring the ideal level of dye modification, we engineered a panel bearing 1–6 amines per subunit: ‘‘amine landscaping.'' Surprisingly, brightness increased as amine number decreased, revealing extensive quenching following conventional labeling. We ultimately selected Flavidin (fluorophore- friendly streptavidin), combining ultrastable ligand binding with increased brightness after conjugation. Flavidin enhanced fluorescent imaging, allowing more sensitive and specific cell labeling in tissues. Flavidin should have wide application in molecular detection, providing a general insight into how to optimize simultaneously the behavior of the biomolecule and the chemical probe.},

Extensive hydrophobic interactions rationalize the high affinity and stability of this complex, pointing to Ski7 as a constitutive component of the cytosolic exosome. Despite the absence of sequence homology, cytoplasmic Ski7 and nuclear Rrp6 bind Exo10 using similar surfaces and recognition motifs. Knowledge of the interacting residues in the yeast complexes allowed us to identify a splice variant of human HBS1-Like as a Ski7-like exosome-binding protein, revealing the evolutionary conservation of this cytoplasmic cofactor.},

In humans, its dysfunction is correlated with several significant diseases, such as diabetes and cancer progression. Investigation of the dynamic regulation of the evolutionarily conserved exocyst-related processes using mutants in genetically tractable organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana is limited by the lethality or the severity of phenotypes. We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling in both plant and human cells and enhancement of plant vacuolar trafficking. An EXO70 protein with a C-terminal truncation results in dominant ES2 resistance, uncovering possible distinct regulatory roles for the N terminus of the protein. This study not only provides a valuable tool in studying exocytosis regulation but also offers a potentially new target for drugs aimed at addressing human disease.},

abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 strains are highly resistant to opsonophagocytosis due to recruitment of the complement inhibitor Factor H via Hic, a member of the pneumococcal surface protein C (PspC) family. In this study, we demonstrated that Hic also interacts with vitronectin, a fluid-phase regulator involved in haemostasis, angiogenesis, and the terminal complement cascade as well as a component of the extracellular matrix. Blocking of Hic by specific antiserum or genetic deletion significantly reduced pneumococcal binding to soluble and immobilised vitronectin and to Factor H, respectively. In parallel, ectopic expression of Hic on the surface of Lactococcus lactis conferred binding to soluble and immobilised vitronectin as well as Factor H. Molecular analyses with truncated Hic fragments narrowed down the vitronectin-binding site to the central core of Hic (aa 151-201). This vitronectin-binding region is separate from that of Factor H, which binds to the N-terminus of Hic (aa 38-92). Binding of pneumococcal Hic was localised to the C-terminal heparin-binding domain (HBD3) of vitronectin. However, an N-terminal region to HBD3 was further involved in Hic-binding to immobilised vitronectin. Finally, vitronectin bound to Hic was functionally active and inhibited formation of the terminal complement complex. In conclusion, Hic interacts with vitronectin and simultaneously with Factor H, and both human proteins may contribute to colonisation and invasive disease caused by serotype 3 pneumococci.},

abstract = {Over the past 25 years, biophysical technologies such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry have become key components of drug discovery platforms in many pharmaceutical companies and academic laboratories. There have been great improvements in the speed, sensitivity and range of possible measurements, providing high-resolution mechanistic, kinetic, thermodynamic and structural information on compound-target interactions. This Review provides a framework to understand this evolution by describing the key biophysical methods, the information they can provide and the ways in which they can be applied at different stages of the drug discovery process. We also discuss the challenges for current technologies and future opportunities to use biophysical methods to solve drug discovery problems.},

abstract = {The anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides uses different energy sources, depending on environmental conditions including aerobic respiration or, in the absence of oxygen, photosynthesis. Photosynthetic genes are repressed at high oxygen tension, but at intermediate levels their partial expression prepares the bacterium for using light energy. Illumination, however, enhances repression under semiaerobic conditions. Here, we describe molecular details of two proteins mediating oxygen and light control of photosynthesis-gene expression: the light-sensing antirepressor AppA and the transcriptional repressor PpsR. Our crystal structures of both proteins and their complex and hydrogen/deuterium-exchange data show that light activation of AppA-PpsR2 affects the PpsR effector region within the complex. DNA binding studies demonstrate the formation of a light-sensitive ternary AppA-PpsR-DNA complex. We discuss implications of these results for regulation by light and oxygen, highlighting new insights into blue light-mediated signal transduction.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have emerged as important and challenging targets in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry. The main difficulty encountered in the discovery of small molecule modulators derives from the large contact surfaces involved in PPIs when compared with those that participate in protein-small molecule interactions. Because of their intrinsic features, peptides can explore larger surfaces and therefore represent a useful alternative to modulate PPIs. The use of peptides as therapeutics has been held back by their instability in vivo and poor cell internalization. However, more than 200 peptide drugs and homologous compounds (proteins or antibodies) containing peptide bonds are (or have been) on the market, and many alternatives are now available to tackle these limitations. This review will focus on the latest progress in the field, spanning from "lead" identification methods to binding evaluation techniques, through an update of the most successful examples described in the literature.},

abstract = {During rotavirus infection, replication and packaging of the viral genome occur in viral factories, termed viroplasms. The viral nonstructural protein NSP5 is a major building block of viroplasms; it recruits the viral polymerase VP1, the core protein VP2, and the ATPase NSP2 inside the viroplasm to form the viral replication complex. Here we report that NSP5 is a unique viral metalloprotein that coordinates a [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster as demonstrated by the metal and labile sulfide contents, UV-visible light absorption, and electron paramagnetic resonance. Point mutations in NSP5 allowed us to identify C171 and C174, arranged in a CXC motif, as essential residues for cluster coordination. When coexpressed with NSP2, an NSP5 mutant devoid of the iron-sulfur cluster still forms viroplasm-like structures. The cluster is therefore neither involved in the interaction with NSP2 nor in the formation of viroplasm-like structures and thus presumably in viroplasm formation. Finally, we show using microscale thermophoresis that the iron-sulfur cluster modulates the affinity of NSP5 for single-stranded RNA. Because the cluster is near the binding sites of both the polymerase VP1 and the ATPase NSP2, we anticipate that this cluster is crucial for NSP5 functions, in either packaging or replication of the viral genome.},

A proper evaluation system mimicking the crowded environment in a cell with macromolecules should be developed to perform structural and functional studies on G-quadruplexes. In this study, the topology and stability of a G-quadruplex formed by human telomeric repeat sequences were investigated in a macromolecule-crowded environment created by polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG200), tumor cell extract, and Xenopus laevis egg extract. The interactions between small molecules and telomeric G-quadruplexes were also evaluated in the different systems. The results suggested that the actual behavior of G-quadruplex structures in cells extract is quite different from that in the PEG crowding system, and proteins or other factors in extracts might play a very important role in G-quadruplex structures.},

A myosin VI construct that used this SAH domain as part of its lever arm was able to take large steps invitro but did not rescue invivo functions. It was necessary for myosin VI to internally dimerize, triggering unfolding of a three-helix bundle and calmodulin binding in order to step normally invitro and rescue endocytosis and Golgi morphology in myosin VI-null fibroblasts. A model for myosin VI emerges in which cargo binding triggers dimerization and unfolds the three-helix bundle to create a lever arm essential for invivo functions.},

abstract = {The DNase I accessibility and chromatin organization of genes within the nucleus do correlate to their transcriptional activity. Here, we show that both serum starvation and overexpression of Tip5, a key regulator of ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) repression, dictate DNase I accessibility, facilitate the association of rDNA with the nuclear matrix and thus regulate large-scale rDNA chromatin organization. Tip5 contains four AT-hooks and a TAM (Tip5/ARBP/MBD) domain, which were proposed to bind matrix-attachment regions (MARs) of the genome. Remarkably, the TAM domain of Tip5 functions as nucleolar localization and nuclear matrix targeting module, whereas AT-hooks do not mediate association with the nuclear matrix, but they are required for nucleolar targeting. These findings suggest a dual role for Tip5's AT-hooks and TAM domain, targeting the nucleolus and anchoring to the nuclear matrix, and suggest a function for Tip5 in the regulation of higher-order rDNA chromatin structure.},

abstract = {High-temperature requirement A1 (HTRA1) is a secreted serine protease reported to play a role in the development of several cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Still, the mechanism underlying the disease processes largely remains undetermined. In age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a common cause of vision impairment and blindness in industrialized societies, two synonymous polymorphisms (rs1049331:C>T, and rs2293870:G>T) in exon 1 of the HTRA1 genewere associated with a high risk to develop disease. Here, we show that the two polymorphisms result in a protein with altered thermophoretic properties upon heat-induced unfolding, trypsin accessibility and secretion behavior, suggesting unique structural features of the AMD-risk-associated HTRA1 protein. Applying MicroScale Thermophoresis and protease digestion analysis, we demonstrate direct binding and proteolysis of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) by normal HTRA1 but not the AMD-risk-associated isoform. As a consequence, both HTRA1 isoforms strongly differed in their ability to control TGF-beta mediated signaling, as revealed by reporter assays targeting the TGF-beta 1-induced serpin peptidase inhibitor (SERPINE1, alias PAI-1) promoter. In addition, structurally altered HTRA1 led to an impaired autocrine TGF-beta signaling in microglia, as measured by a strong down-regulation of downstream effectors of the TGF-beta cascade such as phosphorylated SMAD2 and PAI-1 expression. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the effects of two synonymous HTRA1 variants on protein structure and protein interaction with TGF-beta 1. As a consequence, this leads to an impairment of TGF-beta signaling and microglial regulation. Functional implications of the altered properties on AMD pathogenesis remain to be clarified.},

abstract = {Fragment-based lead discovery has proved to be an effective alternative to high-throughput screenings in identifying chemical matter that can be developed into robust lead compounds. The search for optimal combinations of biophysical techniques that can correctly and efficiently identify and quantify binding can be challenging due to the physicochemical properties of fragments. In order to minimize the time and costs of screening, optimal combinations of biophysical techniques with maximal information content, sensitivity, and robustness are needed. Here we describe an approach utilizing automated microscale thermophoresis (MST) affinity screening to identify fragments active against MEK1 kinase. MST identified multiple hits that were confirmed by X-ray crystallography but not detected by orthogonal methods. Furthermore, MST also provided information about ligand-induced aggregation and protein denaturation. The technique delivered a large number of binders while reducing experimentation time and sample consumption, demonstrating the potential of MST to execute and maximize the efficacy of fragment screening campaigns.},

abstract = {Methionine-1 (M1)-linked ubiquitin chains regulate the activity of NF-??B, immune homeostasis, and responses to infection. The importance of negative regulators of M1-linked chains in??vivo remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the M1-specific deubiquitinase OTULIN is essential for preventing TNF-associated systemic inflammation in humans and mice. A homozygous hypomorphic mutation in human OTULIN causes a potentially fatal autoinflammatory condition termed OTULIN-related autoinflammatory syndrome (ORAS). Four independent OTULIN mouse models reveal that OTULIN deficiency in immune cells results in cell-type-specific effects, ranging from over-production of inflammatory cytokines and autoimmunity due to accumulation of M1-linked polyubiquitin and spontaneous NF-??B activation in myeloid cells to downregulation of M1-polyubiquitin signaling by degradation of LUBAC in B and T??cells. Remarkably, treatment with anti-TNF neutralizing antibodies ameliorates inflammation in ORAS patients and rescues mouse phenotypes. Hence, OTULIN is critical for restraining??life-threatening spontaneous inflammation and maintaining immune homeostasis.},

abstract = {Background Proper spindle assembly and chromosome segregation rely on precise microtubule dynamics, which are governed in part by the kinesin-13 MCAK. MCAK microtubule depolymerization activity is inhibited by Aurora B-dependent phosphorylation, but the mechanism of this inhibition is not understood. Results Here, we develop the first F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensor for MCAK and show that MCAK in solution exists in a closed conformation mediated by an interaction between the C-terminal domain (CT) and the neck. Using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) we show that MCAK bound to microtubule ends is closed relative to MCAK associated with the microtubule lattice. Aurora B phosphorylation at S196 in the neck opens MCAK conformation and diminishes the interaction between the CT and the neck. Using FLIM and TIRF imaging, we find that changes in MCAK conformation are associated with a decrease in MCAK affinity for the microtubule. Conclusions Unlike motile kinesins, which are open when doing work, the high-affinity binding state for microtubule-depolymerizing kinesins is in a closed conformation. Phosphorylation switches MCAK conformation, which inhibits its ability to interact with microtubules and reduces its microtubule depolymerization activity. This work shows that the conformational model proposed for regulating kinesin activity is not universal and that microtubule-depolymerizing kinesins utilize a distinct conformational mode to regulate affinity for the microtubule, thus controlling their catalytic efficiency. Furthermore, our work provides a mechanism by which the robust microtubule depolymerization activity of kinesin-13s can be rapidly modulated to control cellular microtubule dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP) accelerates the aggregation of $\alpha$-synuclein (aSyn), a key protein involved in development of Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. PREP inhibitors reduce aSyn aggregation but the mechanism has remained unknown. We have now used protein-fragment complementation assays (PCA) and microscale thermophoresis (MST) in parallel to show that PREP interacts directly with aSyn in both intact cells and in a cell-free system. Using split luciferase-based PCA, we first showed that PREP enhances the formation of soluble aSyn dimers in live N2A neuroblastoma cells. A PREP inhibitor, KYP-2047, reduced aSyn dimerization in PREP-expressing cells but not in cells lacking PREP expression. aSyn dimerization was also enhanced by PREP(S554A), an enzymatically inactive PREP mutant, but this was not affected by KYP-2047. PCA and MST studies showed that aSyn interacts with both PREP and PREP(S554A) with low micromolar affinity. Neither the proline-rich, C-terminal domain of aSyn or the hydrolytic activity of PREP were required for the interaction with PREP. Our results show that PREP binds directly to aSyn to enhance its dimerization, and may thus serve as a nucleation point for aSyn aggregation. Native gel analysis showed that KYP-2047 shifts PREP to a compact monomeric form with reduced ability to promote aSyn nucleation. As PREP inhibition also enhances autophagic clearance of aSyn, PREP inhibitors may reduce accumulation of aSyn inclusions via a dual mechanism, and are thus a novel therapeutic candidate for synucleinopathies. Our results also suggest that PREP has other cellular functions in addition to its peptidase activity.},

abstract = {Phytosulfokine (PSK) is a disulfated pentapeptide that has a ubi- quitous role in plant growth and development1,2 . PSK is perceived by its receptor PSKR3,4 , a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR- RK). The mechanisms underlying the recognition of PSK, the activation of PSKR and the identity of the components down- stream of the initial binding remain elusive. Here we report the crystal structures of the extracellular LRR domain of PSKR in free, PSK- and co-receptor-bound forms. The structures reveal thatPSK interacts mainly with a b-strand from the island domain of PSKR, forming an anti-b-sheet. The two sulfate moieties of PSK interact directly with PSKR, sensitizing PSKR recognition of PSK. Supported by biochemical, structural and genetic evidence, PSK binding enhances PSKR heterodimerization with the somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinases (SERKs). However, PSK is not directly involved in PSKR–SERK interaction but stabilizes PSKR island domain for recruitment of a SERK. Our data reveal the structural basis for PSKR recognition of PSK and allosteric activation of PSKR by PSK, opening up new avenues for the design of PSKR-specific small molecules.},

abstract = {Microscale thermophoresis (MST) allows for quantitative analysis of protein interactions in free solution and with low sample consumption. The technique is based on thermophoresis, the directed motion of molecules in temperature gradients. Thermophoresis is highly sensitive to all types of binding-induced changes of molecular properties, be it in size, charge, hydration shell or conformation. In an all-optical approach, an infrared laser is used for local heating, and molecule mobility in the temperature gradient is analyzed via fluorescence. In standard MST one binding partner is fluorescently labeled. However, MST can also be performed label-free by exploiting intrinsic protein UV-fluorescence. Despite the high molecular weight ratio, the interaction of small molecules and peptides with proteins is readily accessible by MST. Furthermore, MST assays are highly adaptable to fit to the diverse requirements of different biomolecules, such as membrane proteins to be stabilized in solution. The type of buffer and additives can be chosen freely. Measuring is even possible in complex bioliquids like cell lysate allowing close to in vivo conditions without sample purification. Binding modes that are quantifiable via MST include dimerization, cooperativity and competition. Thus, its flexibility in assay design qualifies MST for analysis of biomolecular interactions in complex experimental settings, which we herein demonstrate by addressing typically challenging types of binding events from various fields of life science.},

abstract = {The binding of four bromobenzotriazoles to the catalytic subunit of human protein kinase CK2 was assessed by two complementary methods: Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC). New algorithm proposed for the global analysis of MST pseudo-titration data enabled reliable determination of binding affinities for two distinct sites, a relatively strong one with the Kd of the order of 100 nM and a substantially weaker one (Kd > 1 $\mu$M). The affinities for the strong binding site determined for the same protein-ligand systems using ITC were in most cases approximately 10-fold underestimated. The discrepancy was assigned directly to the kinetics of ligand nano-aggregates decay occurring upon injection of the concentrated ligand solution to the protein sample. The binding affinities determined in the reverse ITC experiment, in which ligands were titrated with a concentrated protein solution, agreed with the MST-derived data. Our analysis suggests that some ITC-derived Kd values, routinely reported together with PDB structures of protein-ligand complexes, may be biased due to the uncontrolled ligand (nano)-aggregation, which may occur even substantially below the solubility limit.},

abstract = {The Protein Disulfide Isomerase PDI is involved in VWF dimerization by initiating disulfide bond formation at cysteines 2771 and 2773.Von Willebrand disease-associated mutations in the dimerization domain of von Willebrand factor disturb processing by PDI. Multimeric von Willebrand factor (VWF) is essential for primary hemostasis. The biosynthesis of VWF high molecular weight multimers requires spatial separation of each step due to varying pH value requirements. VWF is dimerized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by formation of disulfide bonds between the CK domains of two monomers. Here, we investigated the basic question which protein catalyzes the dimerization. We examined the putative interaction of VWF and the protein disulfide isomerase PDIA1, which has previously been used to visualize ER localization of VWF. Excitingly, we were able to visualize the PDI-VWF-dimer-complex by high-resolution STORM and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). We proved and quantified direct binding of PDIA1 to VWF using Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) and Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) (dissociation constants KD = 236±66 nM and KD = 282±123 nM by MST and FCS, respectively). The similar KD (258±104 nM) measured for PDI interaction with the isolated CK domain and the AFM images strongly indicate that PDIA1 binds exclusively to the CK domain, suggesting a key role of PDIA1 in VWF dimerization. Based on protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics simulations, combined with fluorescence microscopy studies of VWF CK-domain-mutants, we suggest the following mechanism of VWF dimerization: PDI initiates VWF dimerization by forming the first two disulfide bonds Cys2771-2773' and Cys2771'-2773. Subsequently, the third bond Cys2811-2811' is formed, presumably, to protect the first two bonds from reduction, thereby rendering dimerization irreversible. This study deepens our understanding of the mechanism of VWF dimerization and the pathophysiological consequences of its inhibition.},

abstract = {Activity-dependent neurite outgrowth is a highly complex, regulated process with important implications for neuronal circuit remodeling in development as well as in seizure-induced sprouting in epilepsy. Recent work has linked outgrowth to collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), an intracellular phosphoprotein originally identified as axon guidance and growth cone collapse protein. The neurite outgrowth promoting function of CRMP2 is regulated by its phosphorylation state. In this study, depolarization (potassium chloride)-driven activity increased the level of active CRMP2 by decreasing its phosphorylation by GSK3&#x3B2; via a reduction in priming by Cdk5. To determine the contribution of CRMP2 in activity-driven neurite outgrowth, we screened a limited set of compounds for their ability to reduce neurite outgrowth but not modify voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) biophysical properties. This led to the identification of (S)-lacosamide ((S)-LCM), a stereoisomer of the clinically used antiepileptic drug (R)-LCM (Vimpat&#xAE;), as a novel tool for preferentially targeting CRMP2-mediated neurite outgrowth. Whereas (S)-LCM was ineffective in targeting VGSCs, the presumptive pharmacological targets of (R)-LCM, (S)-LCM was more efficient than (R)-LCM in subverting neurite outgrowth. Biomolecular interaction analyses revealed that (S)-LCM bound to wildtype CRMP2 with low micromolar affinity, similar to (R)-LCM. Through the use of this novel tool, the activity-dependent increase in neurite outgrowth observed following depolarization was characterized to be reliant on CRMP2 function. Knockdown of CRMP2 by siRNA in cortical neurons resulted in reduced CRMP2-dependent neurite outgrowth; incubation with (S)-LCM phenocopied this effect. Other CRMP2-mediated processes were unaffected. (S)-LCM subverted neurite outgrowth not by affecting the canonical CRMP2-tubulin association but rather by impairing the ability of CRMP2 to promote tubulin polymerization, events that are perfunctory for neurite outgrowth. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in the phosphorylation state of CRMP2 are a major contributing factor in activity-dependent regulation of neurite outgrowth.},

abstract = {Summary While recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) has been widely used to treat anemia in cancer patients, concerns about its adverse effects on patient survival have emerged. A lack of correlation between expression of the canonical EpoR and rhEpo's effects on cancer cells prompted us to consider the existence of an alternative Epo receptor. Here, we identified EphB4 as an Epo receptor that triggers downstream signaling via STAT3 and promotes rhEpo-induced tumor growth and progression. In human ovarian and breast cancer samples, expression of EphB4 rather than the canonical EpoR correlated with decreased disease-specific survival in rhEpo-treated patients. These results identify EphB4 as a critical mediator of erythropoietin-induced tumor progression and further provide clinically significant dimension to the biology of erythropoietin.},

We addressed the role of subtilisin-like proteinases (SBTs) in this process. Using tissue-specific expression of proteinase inhibitors as a tool to overcome functional redundancy, SBT activity was found to be required for the maturation of IDA (INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION), a peptide signal for the abscission of floral organs in Arabidopsis. We identified three SBTs that process the IDA precursor in vitro, and this processing was shown to be required for the formation of mIDA as the endogenous signaling peptide in vivo. We conclude that SBTs act as pro-hormone convertases in plants, and that several functionally redundant SBTs contribute to signal biogenesis.},

Here we report a crystal structure of the syntenin PDZ tandem in complex with the carboxy-terminal fragment of Frizzled 7 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). The crystal structure reveals a tripartite interaction formed via the second PDZ domain of syntenin. Biophysical and biochemical experiments establish co-operative binding of the tripartite complex and identify residues crucial for membrane PIP2-specific recognition. Experiments with cells support the importance of the syntenin-PIP2 interaction for plasma membrane targeting of Frizzled 7 and c-jun phosphorylation. This study contributes to our understanding of the biology of PDZ proteins as key players in membrane compartmentalization and dynamics.},

abstract = {Amyloid fibrils are a hallmark of a range of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. A detailed understanding of the physico-chemical properties of the different aggregated forms of proteins, and of their interactions with other compounds of diagnostic or therapeutic interest, is crucial for devising effective strategies against such diseases. Protein aggregates are situated at the boundary between soluble and insoluble structures, and are challenging to study because classical biophysical techniques, such as scattering, spectroscopic and calorimetric methods, are not well adapted for their study. Here we present a detailed characterization of the thermophoretic behavior of different forms of the protein $\alpha$-synuclein, whose aggregation is associated with Parkinson's disease. Thermophoresis is the directed net diffusional flux of molecules and colloidal particles in a temperature gradient. Because of their low volume requirements and rapidity, analytical methods based on this effect have considerable potential for high throughput screening for drug discovery. In this paper we rationalize and describe in quantitative terms the thermophoretic behavior of monomeric, oligomeric and fibrillar forms of $\alpha$-synuclein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that microscale thermophoresis (MST) is a valuable method for screening for ligands and binding partners of even such highly challenging samples as supramolecular protein aggregates.},

For example, Growth Arrest and DNA Damage 45-(GADD45) and Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET) proteins act in active DNA demethylation but their functional relationship is unresolved. Here we show that GADD45a physically interacts – and functionally cooperates with TET1 in methylcytosine (mC) processing. In reporter demethylation GADD45a requires endogenous TET1 and conversely TET1 requires GADD45a. On GADD45a target genes TET1 hyperinduces 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) in the presence of GADD45a, while 5-formyl-(fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (caC) are reduced. Likewise, in global analysis GADD45a positively regulates TET1 mediated mC oxidation and enhances fC/caC removal. Our data suggest a dual function of GADD45a in oxidative DNA demethylation, to promote directly or indirectly TET1 activity and to enhance subsequent fC/caC removal.},

abstract = {The analysis of binding interactions between small molecules and biopolymers is important for understanding biological processes. While fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) requires fluorescence labeling on the small molecule, which often interferes with binding, in microscale thermophoresis (MST) the label can be placed on the biopolymer. Ribozymes have not been analyzed by MST so far. The Diels-Alderase ribozyme (DAse) is a true catalyst, facilitating the Diels-Alder reaction between two free small substrates, anthracene dienes, and maleimide dienophiles. Despite high efforts, the determination of the dissociation constant (KD) of maleimide dienophiles to the DAse by FCS has been unsuccessful. Here, we determined the binding interactions of the DAse to its substrates and the Diels-Alder product using MST. The results supported a positive cooperativity for substrate binding to the DAse. By varying the temperature, we furthermore studied the thermodynamics of dienophile dissociation. The entropic contribution was found to be the energetic driving force for the binding of the dienophile to the DAse.},

Therefore, they might be an alternative to antibodies as detection molecules in biosensors. Aptamers are well suited for this application since they can be directed against almost every molecular target, and show high binding affinities to their corresponding binding partner. Aptamers with a terminal amino-group can be coupled to organic or inorganic fluorophores via amide bonds to enable their optical detection. In this study Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)-binding aptamers were conjugated with quantum dot molecules. This immobilization may inhibit the correct aptamer folding and consequently lead to a declined target-binding activity. Therefore, MST technology was used to determine whether quantum dot conjugation affects the VEGF-binding affinity of aptamers.},

abstract = {Dendritic polyglycerols (dPG) are water soluble, polyether-based nanomaterials which hold great potential in diagnostic as well as therapeutic applications. In order to translate them for in vivo applications, a systematic assessment regarding their cell and tissue interactions as well as their metabolic fate in vivo is a crucial step. Herein, we explore the structure-activity relationship of three different sizes (ca. 3, 5, and 10 nm) of neutral dendritic polyglycerol (dPG) and their corresponding negatively charged sulfate analogs (dPGS) on their in vitro and in vivo characteristics. Cellular metabolic activity was studied in A431 and HEK293 cells. Biomolecular corona formation was determined using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, which showed an increased protein binding of the dPGS even with serum concentrations as low as 20%. An in situ technique, microscale thermophoresis, was employed to address the binding affinities of these nanomaterials with serum proteins such as serum albumin, apo-transferrin, and fibrinogen. In addition, nanoparticle-cell interactions were studied in differentiated THP-1 cells which showed a charge dependent scavenger receptor-mediated uptake. In line with this data, detailed biodistribution and small animal PET imaging studies in Wistar rats using 68Ga-labeled dPG-/dPGS-NOTA conjugates showed that the neutral dPG-NOTA conjugates were quantitatively excreted via the kidneys with a subsequent hepatobiliary excretion with an increase in their size, whereas the polysulfated analogs (dPGS-NOTA) were sequestered preferentially in the liver and kidneys irrespective of their size. Taken together, this systematic study accentuates that the pharmacokinetics of dPGs is critically dependent on the overall size and charge and can be, fine-tuned for the intended requirements in nano-theranostics.},

abstract = {Complement activation plays a major role in many acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. C3d, a terminal product of complement activation, remains covalently attached to cells and is an excellent biomarker of complement-mediated inflammation. We employed a virtual high-throughput screening protocol to identify molecules with predicted binding to complement C3d and with intrinsic fluorescence properties to enable detection. Pharmacophore models were developed based on known C3d-ligand interactions and information from computational analysis of structural and molecular dynamics data. Iterative pharmacophore-based virtual screening was performed to identify druglike molecules with physicochemical similarity to the natural C3d ligand CR2. Hits from the pharmacophore screens were docked to C3d and ranked based on predicted binding free energies. Top-ranked molecules were selected for experimental validation of binding affinity to C3d, using microscale thermophoresis, and for their suitability to become molecular imaging agents, using fluorescence spectroscopy. This work serves as a foundation for identifying additional fluorescent molecules with high-affinity for C3d that will subsequently be explored as noninvasive in vivo diagnostics of complement-mediated inflammation, for spatiotemporal monitoring of disease progression, and for targeting therapeutics to sites of inflammation.},

abstract = {The packaging of DNA into nucleosomes and the organisation into higher order structures of chromatin limits the access of sequence specific DNA binding factors to DNA. In cells, DNA methylation is preferentially occuring in the linker region of nucleosomes, suggesting a structural impact of chromatin on DNA methylation. These observations raise the question whether DNA methyltransferases are capable to recognize the nucleosomal substrates and to modify the packaged DNA. Here, we performed a detailed analysis of nucleosome binding and nucleosomal DNA methylation by the maintenance DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1. Our binding studies show that Dnmt1 has a DNA length sensing activity, binding cooperatively to DNA, and requiring a minimal DNA length of 20 bp. Dnmt1 needs linker DNA to bind to nucleosomes and most efficiently recognizes nucleosomes with symmetric DNA linkers. Footprinting experiments reveal that Dnmt1 binds to both DNA linkers exiting the nucleosome core. The binding pattern correlates with the efficient methylation of DNA linkers. However, the enzyme lacks the ability to methylate nucleosomal CpG sites on mononucleosomes and nucleosomal arrays, unless chromatin remodeling enzymes create a dynamic chromatin state. In addition, our results show that Dnmt1 functionally interacts with specific chromatin remodeling enzymes to enable complete methylation of hemi-methylated DNA in chromatin.},

Application of the method to STAT3-GFP transiently expressed in HEK293 cells allowed to determine for the first time the affinity of the well-studied transcription factor to oligonucleotides with different sequences.

abstract = {Cyanidin, a key flavonoid that is present in red berries and other fruits, attenuates the development of several diseases, including asthma, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cancer, through its anti- inflammatory effects. We investigated the molecular basis of cyanidin action. Through a structure- based search for small molecules that inhibit signaling by the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A), we found that cyanidin specifically recognizes an IL-17A binding site in the IL-17A receptor subunit (IL-17RA) and inhibits the IL-17A/IL-17RA interaction. Experiments with mice demonstrated that cyanidin inhibited IL-17A–induced skin hyperplasia, attenuated inflammation induced by IL-17–producing T helper 17 (TH17) cells (but not that induced by TH1 or TH2 cells), and alleviated airway hyperreactivity in models of steroid-resistant and severe asthma. Our findings uncover a previously uncharacterized molecular mechanism of action of cyanidin, which may inform its further development into an effective small-molecule drug for the treatment of IL-17A–dependent inflammatory diseases and cancer.},

abstract = {The eukaryotic RNA exosome participates extensively in RNA processing and degradation. In human cells, three accessory factors (RBM7, ZCCHC8 and hMTR4) interact to form the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex, which directs a subset of non-coding RNAs for exosomal degradation. Here we elucidate how RBM7 is incorporated in the NEXT complex. We identify a proline-rich segment of ZCCHC8 as the interaction site for the RNA-recognition motif (RRM) of RBM7 and present the crystal structure of the corresponding complex at 2.0 {\AA} resolution. On the basis of the structure, we identify a proline-rich segment within the splicing factor SAP145 with strong similarity to ZCCHC8. We show that this segment of SAP145 not only binds the RRM region of another splicing factor SAP49 but also the RRM of RBM7. These dual interactions of RBM7 with the exosome and the spliceosome suggest a model whereby NEXT might recruit the exosome to degrade intronic RNAs.},

abstract = {AbstractBackground Equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) facilitate the import of nucleosides and their analogs into cells in a bidirectional, non-concentrative manner. However, in contrast to their name, most characterized plant ENTs act in a concentrative manner. A direct characterization of any ENT protein has been hindered due to difficulties in overexpression and obtaining pure recombinant protein. Methods The equilibrative nucleoside transporter 7 from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtENT7) was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes to assess mechanism of substrate uptake. Recombinant protein fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) was expressed in Pichia pastoris to characterize the protein by gel filtration and substrate binding by microscale thermophoresis (MST). Results AtENT7 expressed in X. laevis oocytes works as a classic equilibrative transporter. The expression of AtENT7-eGFP in the P. pastoris system yielded milligram amounts of pure protein that are stable homodimers. The concentration dependent binding of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides to the purified recombinant protein, assessed by MST, confirmed that AtENT7-eGFP is properly folded. For the first time the binding of nucleobases was observed for AtENT7. Significance The availability of pure recombinant AtENT7 will permit detailed kinetic and structural studies of this unique member of the ENT family and, given the functional similarity to mammalian ENTs, will serve as a good model for understanding the structural basis of translocation mechanism for the family.},

abstract = {Epigenetic regulation is based on specific molecular interactions between epigenetic reader, writer and eraser molecules and chromatin. Binding parameters of these interactions such as binding affinities, stoichiometries and thermodynamics are essential for the understanding of the establishment and maintenance of epigenetic networks. The MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) is a rapid and precise method to characterize epigenetic interactions in solution at microliter scale, requiring low concentrations of the potential interactors. The technology is based on the movement of molecules through temperature gradients, a physical effect referred to as thermophoresis. The thermophoretic movement of a molecule depends on its size, charge and hydration shell. Upon the interaction of two molecules, at least one of these parameters is altered, leading to a change in the movement behavior, which can be used to quantify molecular interactions. MST offers free choice of buffers, also allowing measurements in serum and crude extracts, thereby ensuring optimal reaction conditions. Binding affinities from pM to mM can be measured, perfectly suited to analyze protein/protein, protein/modified peptide and protein/nucleic acid interactions in epigenetics. This review demonstrates the potential of this rapid and versatile technology in the characterization of epigenetic modifiers.},

Progressive removal of pore arginines results in a dose-dependent and concomitant decrease in nucleotide affinity, reverse transcription and infectivity. This positively charged channel is universally conserved in lentiviral capsids despite the fact that it is strongly destabilizing without nucleotides to counteract charge repulsion. We also describe a channel inhibitor, hexacarboxybenzene, which competes for nucleotide binding and efficiently blocks encapsidated reverse transcription, demonstrating the tractability of the pore as a novel drug target.},

abstract = {The CRISPR-Cas systems, as exemplified by CRISPR-Cas9, are RNA-guided adaptive immune systems used by bacteria and archaea to defend against viral infection. The CRISPR-Cpf1 system, a new class 2 CRISPR-Cas system, mediates robust DNA interference in human cells. Although functionally conserved, Cpf1 and Cas9 differ in many aspects including their guide RNAs and substrate specificity. Here we report the 2.38 {\AA} crystal structure of the CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-bound Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006 Cpf1 (LbCpf1). LbCpf1 has a triangle-shaped architecture with a large positively charged channel at the centre. Recognized by the oligonucleotide-binding domain of LbCpf1, the crRNA adopts a highly distorted conformation stabilized by extensive intramolecular interactions and the (Mg(H2O)6)(2+) ion. The oligonucleotide-binding domain also harbours a looped-out helical domain that is important for LbCpf1 substrate binding. Binding of crRNA or crRNA lacking the guide sequence induces marked conformational changes but no oligomerization of LbCpf1. Our study reveals the crRNA recognition mechanism and provides insight into crRNA-guided substrate binding of LbCpf1, establishing a framework for engineering LbCpf1 to improve its efficiency and specificity for genome editing.},

abstract = {Protein translocation across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane is an essential process catalyzed predominantly by the Sec translocase. This system consists of the membrane-embedded protein-conducting channel SecYEG, the motor ATPase SecA, and the heterotrimeric SecDFyajC membrane protein complex. Previous studies suggest that anionic lipids are essential for SecA activity and that the N terminus of SecA is capable of penetrating the lipid bilayer. The role of lipid binding, however, has remained elusive. By employing differently sized nanodiscs reconstituted with single SecYEG complexes and comprising varying amounts of lipids, we establish that SecA gains access to the SecYEG complex via a lipid-bound intermediate state, whereas acidic phospholipids allosterically activate SecA for ATP-dependent protein translocation.},

abstract = {Several ubiquitin chain types have remained unstudied, mainly because tools and techniques to detect these posttranslational modifications are scarce. Linkage-specific antibodies have shaped our understanding of the roles and dynamics of polyubiquitin signals but are available for only five out of eight linkage types. We here characterize K6- and K33-linkage-specific “affimer” reagents as high-affinity ubiquitin interactors. Crystal structures of affimers bound to their cognate chain types reveal mechanisms of specificity and a K11 cross-reactivity in the K33 affimer. Structure-guided improvements yield superior affinity reagents suitable for western blotting, confocal fluorescence microscopy and pull-down applications. This allowed us to identify RNF144A and RNF144B as E3 ligases that assemble K6-, K11-, and K48-linked polyubiquitin in vitro. A protocol to enrich K6-ubiquitinated proteins from cells identifies HUWE1 as a main E3 ligase for this chain type, and we show that mitofusin-2 is modified with K6-linked polyubiquitin in a HUWE1-dependent manner. Michel et al. describe linkage-specific tools for the study of atypical K6 and K33/K11 ubiquitin linkages. Affimers have applications in western blotting, confocal microscopy, and pull-downs. Using a K6-specific affimer, they reveal that HUWE1 is a major source of cellular K6 chains and decorates Mfn2 with K6 chains.},

abstract = {Information transmission in biological signaling networks is commonly considered to be a unidirectional flow of information between protein partners. According to this view, many bacterial response regulator proteins utilize input receiver (REC) domains to “switch” functional outputs, using REC phosphorylation to shift pre-existing equilibria between inactive and active conformations. However, recent data indicate that output domains themselves also shift such equilibria, implying a “mutual inhibition” model. Here we use solution nuclear magnetic resonance to provide a mechanistic basis for such control in a PhyR-type response regulator. Our structure of the isolated, non-phosphorylated REC domain surprisingly reveals a fully active conformation, letting us identify structural and dynamic changes imparted by the output domain to inactivate the full-length protein. Additional data reveal transient structural changes within the full-length protein, facilitating activation. Our data provide a basis for understanding the changes that REC and output domains undergo to set a default “inactive” state.},

abstract = {The interest in RNA modification enzymes surges due to their involvement in epigenetic phenomena. Here we present a particularly informative approach to investigate the interaction of dye-labeled RNA with modification enzymes. We investigated pseudouridine ($\Psi$) synthase TruB interacting with an alleged suicide substrate RNA containing 5-fluorouridine (5FU). A longstanding dogma, stipulating formation of a stable covalent complex was challenged by discrepancies between the time scale of complex formation and enzymatic turnover. Instead of classic mutagenesis, we used differentially positioned fluorescent labels to modulate substrate properties in a range of enzymatic conversion between 6% and 99%. Despite this variegation, formation of SDS-stable complexes occurred instantaneously for all 5FU-substrates. Protein binding was investigated by advanced fluorescence spectroscopy allowing unprecedented simultaneous detection of change in fluorescence lifetime, anisotropy decay, as well as emission and excitation maxima. Determination of Kd values showed that introduction of 5FU into the RNA substrate increased protein affinity by 14× at most. Finally, competition experiments demonstrated reversibility of complex formation for 5FU-RNA. Our results lead us to conclude that the hitherto postulated long-term covalent interaction of TruB with 5FU tRNA is based on the interpretation of artifacts. This is likely true for the entire class of pseudouridine synthases.},

Besides, TRPV4 mechano/osmosensitivity depends on phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activation and subsequent production of AA and EETs. However, the lack of evidence for a direct interaction of EETs with TRPV4 together with claims of EET-independent mechanical activation of TRPV4 has cast doubts on the validity of this mechanism. We now report: 1) The identification of an EET-binding pocket that specifically mediates TRPV4 activation by 5′,6′-EET, AA and hypotonic cell swelling, thereby suggesting that all these stimuli shared a common structural target within the TRPV4 channel; and 2) A structural insight into the gating of TRPV4 by a natural agonist (5′,6′-EET) in which K535 plays a crucial role, as mutant TRPV4-K535A losses binding of and gating by EET, without affecting GSK1016790A, 4$\alpha$-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate and heat mediated channel activation. Together, our data demonstrates that the mechano- and osmotransducing messenger EET gates TRPV4 by a direct action on a site formed by residues from the S2-S3 linker, S4 and S4-S5 linker.},

abstract = {Genome sequencing has led to the identification of many proteins, which had not been recognized before. In consequence, the basic set of human proteins is generally known. Far less information, however, exists about protein-protein interactions, which are required and responsible for cellular activities and their control. Many protein isoforms that result from mutations, splice-variations and post-translational modifications also come into play. Until recently, interactions of only few protein partners could be analyzed in a single experiment. However, this does not meet the challenge of investigating the highly complex interaction patterns in cellular systems. It is made even more demanding by the need to determine the intensity of interactions quantitatively in order to properly understand protein interplay. Currently available techniques vary with respect to accuracy, reliability, reproducibility and throughput and their performances range from a mere qualitative demonstration of binding to a quantitative characterization of affinities. In this article, an overview is given of the methodologies available for analysis of protein-protein interactions.},

abstract = {Trigger factor (TF) is the only ribosome-associated chaperone in bacteria. It interacts with hydrophobic segments in nascent chain (NCs) as they emerge from the ribosome. TF binds via its N-terminal ribosome-binding domain (RBD) mainly to ribosomal protein uL23 at the tunnel exit on the large ribosomal subunit. Whereas earlier structural data suggested that TF binds as a rigid molecule to the ribosome, recent comparisons of structural data on substrate-bound, ribosome-bound, and TF in solution from different species suggest that this chaperone is a rather flexible molecule. Here, we present two cryo-electron microscopy structures of TF bound to ribosomes translating an mRNA coding for a known TF substrate from Escherichia coli of a different length. The structures reveal distinct degrees of flexibility for the different TF domains, a conformational rearrangement of the RBD upon ribosome binding, and an increase in rigidity within TF when the NC is extended. Molecular dynamics simulations agree with these data and offer a molecular basis for these observations.},

abstract = {WRINKLED1 (WRI1), the transcriptional activator of fatty acid synthesis, was recently identified as a target of KIN10, a catalytic $\alpha$-subunit of the SUCROSE-NON-FERMENTING1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE1 (SnRK1). We tested the hypothesis that trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P), a signal of cellular sucrose status, can regulate fatty acid synthesis by inhibiting SnRK1. Incubation of Brassica napus suspension cells in medium containing T6P, or overexpression of the Escherichia coli T6P synthase, OtsA, in Nicotiana benthamiana, significantly increased T6P levels, WRI1 levels, and fatty acid synthesis rates. T6P directly bound to purified recombinant KIN10 with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 32 ± 6 $\mu$M based on microscale thermophoresis. GEMINIVIRUS REP-INTERACTING KINASE1 (GRIK1) bound to KIN10 (Kd 19 ± 3 $\mu$M) and activated it by phosphorylation. In the presence of T6P, the GRIK1-KIN10 association was weakened by more than 3-fold (Kd 68 ± 9.8 $\mu$M), which reduced both the phosphorylation of KIN10 and its activity. T6P-dependent inhibition of SnRK1 activity was reduced in extracts of individual Arabidopsis thaliana grik1 and grik2 mutants relative to the wild type, while SnRK1 activity in grik1 grik2 extracts was enhanced by T6P. These results indicate that the T6P sensitivity of SnRK1 in vivo is GRIK1/GRIK2 dependent. Based on our findings, we propose a mechanistic model that links sugar signaling and fatty acid homeostasis.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Homing endonucleases recognize and generate a DNA double-strand break, which has been used to promote gene targeting. These enzymes recognize long DNA stretches; they are highly sequence-specific enzymes and display a very low frequency of cleavage even in complete genomes. Although a large number of homing endonucleases have been identified, the landscape of possible target sequences is still very limited to cover the complexity of the whole eukaryotic genome. Therefore the finding and molecular analysis of homing endonucleases identified but not yet characterized may widen the landscape of possible target sequences. The previous characterization of protein-DNA interaction before the engineering of new homing endonucleases is essential for further enzyme modification. Here we report the crystal structure of I-CvuI in complex with its target DNA and with the target DNA of I-CreI, a homologue enzyme widely use in genome engineering. To characterize the enzyme cleavage mechanism we have solved the I-CvuI DNA structures in the presence of non-catalytic (Ca2+) and catalytic ions (Mg2+). We have also analyzed the metal dependence of DNA cleavage using Mg2+ ions at different concentrations ranging from non- cleavable to cleavable concentrations obtained from in vitro cleavage experiments. The structure of I-CvuI homing endonuclease expands the current repertoire for engineering custom specificities, both by itself as a new scaffold alone or in hybrid constructs with other related homing endonucleases or other DNA binding protein templates.},

abstract = {Summary During red-blood-cell-stage infection of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite undergoes repeated rounds of replication, egress, and invasion. Erythrocyte invasion involves specific interactions between host cell receptors and parasite ligands and coordinated expression of genes specific to this step of the life cycle. We show that a parasite-specific bromodomain protein, PfBDP1, binds to chromatin at transcriptional start sites of invasion-related genes and directly controls their expression. Conditional PfBDP1 knockdown causes a dramatic defect in parasite invasion and growth and results in transcriptional downregulation of multiple invasion-related genes at a time point critical for invasion. Conversely, PfBDP1 overexpression enhances expression of these same invasion-related genes. PfBDP1 binds to acetylated histone H3 and a second bromodomain protein, PfBDP2, suggesting a potential mechanism for gene recognition and control. Collectively, these findings show that PfBDP1 critically coordinates expression of invasion genes and indicate that targeting PfBDP1 could be an invaluable tool in malaria eradication.},

abstract = {The hypoxia-inducible factor complex (HIF-$\alpha${\textperiodcentered}aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)) requires association with several transcription coactivators for a successful cellular response to hypoxic stress. In addition to the conventional global transcription coactivator CREB-binding protein/p300 (CBP/p300) that binds to the HIF-$\alpha$ transactivation domain, a new group of transcription coactivators called the coiled-coil coactivators (CCCs) interact directly with the second PER-ARNT-SIM (PAS) domain of ARNT (ARNT PAS-B). These less studied transcription coactivators play essential roles in the HIF-dependent hypoxia response, and CCC misregulation is associated with several forms of cancer. To better understand CCC protein recruitment by the heterodimeric HIF transcription factor, we used x-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and biochemical methods to investigate the structure of the ARNT PAS-B domain in complex with the C-terminal fragment of a coiled-coil coactivator protein, transforming acidic coiled-coil coactivator 3 (TACC3). We found that the HIF-2$\alpha$ PAS-B domain also directly interacts with TACC3, motivating an NMR data-derived model suggesting a means by which TACC3 could form a ternary complex with HIF-2$\alpha$ PAS-B and ARNT PAS-B via $\beta$-sheet/coiled-coil interactions. These findings suggest that TACC3 could be recruited as a bridge to cooperatively mediate between the HIF-2$\alpha$ PAS-B{\textperiodcentered}ARNT PAS-B complex, thereby participating more directly in HIF-dependent gene transcription than previously anticipated.},

Small molecule activators for the human sirtuins Sirt1-7 are sought as chemical tools and potential therapeutics, such as for cancer. Activators are available for Sirt1 and exploit its unique N-terminus, whereas drug-like activators for Sirt2-7 are lacking. We synthesized and screened pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoxaline derivatives, yielding the first synthetic Sirt6 activators. Biochemical assays show direct, substrate-independent compound binding to the Sirt6 catalytic core and potent activation of Sirt6-dependent deacetylation of peptide substrates and complete nucleosomes. Crystal structures of Sirt6/activator complexes reveal that the compounds bind to a Sirt6-specific acyl channel pocket and identify key interactions. Our results establish potent Sirt6 activation with small molecules and provide a structural basis for further development of Sirt6 activators as tools and therapeutics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hexokinase (HK) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the first reaction of glycolysis. And Hexokinase 2 (HK2) is most closely related to malignant tumor which expresses at higher level compared with normal cells. HK2 plays a pivotal role in tumor initiation and maintenance, which provides a new target for cancer therapy. METHODS: Structure-based virtual ligand screening was used in hit identification from ZINC Drug Database. Microscale thermophoresis assay was performed to evaluate the binding affinity. Enzyme inhibition, cytotoxicity, apoptosis, intracellular ATP level, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), glucose uptake and lactate production experiments were undertaken in SW480 cells to identify Benz as a HK2 inhibitor. Western blot was used to test protein expression. SW480 cells xenograft mouse models were used for in vivo study. Nano-particles of Benz were prepared to improve the antitumor efficacy and tumor targeting of Benz. HPLC was used to measure the concentration of free Benz in tumor tissues. RESULTS: Benserazide (Benz), was identified as a selective HK2 inhibitor, could specifically bind to HK2 and significantly inhibit HK2 enzymatic activity in vitro. In addition, Benz reduced glucose uptake, lactate production and intracellular ATP level, and could cause cell apoptosis and an increased loss of MMP as well. In vivo study indicated that intraperitoneal (ip) injection of Benz at 300 and 600 mg/Kg suppressed cancer growth in tumor-bearing mice and no toxicity shown. To further improve the antitumor efficacy and tumor targeting of Benz, nano-particles of Benz was prepared. Liposomal Benz at 100 and 200 mg/Kg performed potent inhibitory effects on tumor-bearing mice, showing reduced dose and better efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a new direction for the development of Benz and its analogues as novel antitumor agents for cancer therapy.},

Superior thermal stability of the mutant versus the wildtype in methanol was confirmed by intrinsic protein fluorescence measurements. The influence of skim milk and soluble E. coli lysate proteins as bulking and stabilizing agents in conjunction with sol-gel entrapment were investigated. E. coli lysate proteins were better stabilizing agents of the purified lipase mutant than skim milk, as evidenced by reverse engineering of the aromatic-based system. This was also shown for commercial Candida antarctica lipase B (CaLB) and Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLL). Uniform, dense, and nonaggregated particles imaged by scanning electron microscopy and a small particle size of 13 $\mu$m pertaining to the system comprising PTEOS and E. coli lysate proteins correlated well with high esterification activity. Combining protein and immobilization engineering resulted in a durable biocatalyst with efficient recycling ability and high biodiesel conversion rates.},

The binding properties of the effector Nore1A to active K-Ras-GppNHp and to inactive K-Ras-GDP were analyzed with a label-free surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor. The measured phase signal was used for the concomitant evaluation of the binding kinetics. Binding was observed only to the active K-Ras-GppNHp complex. An affinity decrease based on an increase in ionic strength was detected from the calculated KD's in the range of 6.6 × 10-8M in 100 mM NaCl and of 1.1 × 10-6M in 500 mM NaCl. The recorded amplitude signal was used as a measure of the conformational changes. It could be shown that at 100 mM NaCl, the interaction causes an increase in rigidity. At 500 mM NaCl, no increase in rigidity was measured at high concentrations of Nore1A due to reduced binding, suggesting an influence of salt on protein rigidity and hence on the strength of binding. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Multidrug resistance, a major problem that leads to failure of anticancer chemotherapy, requires the development of new drugs. Repurposing of old drugs is a promising approach for overcoming this problem. An example of such drugs is niclosamide, a known anthelmintic that is now known to be cytotoxic and cytostatic against cancer cells. In this study niclosamide showed varying activity against different cancer cell lines. It revealed better activity against hematological cancer cell lines CCRF-CEM, CEM/ADR5000 and RPMI-8226 compared to the solid tumor cell lines MDA-MB-231, A549 and HT-29. The multidrug resistant CEM/ADR5000 cells conferred cross-sensitivity compared to its sensitive counterpart CCRF-CEM, with a resistance ratio of 1.24. Furthermore, niclosamide caused elevations in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione levels in leukemia cells. Glutathione synthetase (GS) was predicted as a target of niclosamide. Molecular docking showed that niclosamide probably binds to the ATP- binding site of GS with a binding energy of -9.40 kcal/mol. Using microscale thermophoresis, the binding affinity between niclosamide an recombinant human GS was measured, which gave a binding constant of 5.64 $\mu$M. COMPARE analyses of the NCI microarray database for 60 cell lines showed that several genes, including those involved in lipid metabolism, correlated with cellular responsiveness to niclosamide. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed five major branches with significant differences between sensitive and resistant cell lines (p= 8.66 × 105). Niclosamide significantly decreased NFAT activity as predicted by promoter binding motif analysis. In conclusion, niclosamide is more active against hematological malignancies compared to solid tumors. It is particularly active against the multidrug-resistant CEM/ADR 5000 leukemia cells. Inhibition of glutathione synthesis and NFAT signaling are two more mechanisms for the anticancer activity of niclosamide. Gene expression profiling can be used to predict the sensitivity or resistance of cancer cells to niclosamide.},

abstract = {The SecY/61 complex forms the protein-channel component of the ubiquitous protein secretion and membrane protein insertion apparatus. The bacterial version SecYEG interacts with the highly conserved YidC and SecDF–YajC subcomplex, which facilitates translocation into and across the membrane. Together, they form the holo-translocon (HTL), which we have successfully overexpressed and purified. In contrast to the homo-dimeric SecYEG, the HTL is a hetero-dimer composed of single copies of SecYEG and SecDF–YajC–YidC. The activities of the HTL differ from the archetypal SecYEG complex. It is more effective in cotranslational insertion of membrane proteins and the posttranslational secretion of a $\beta$-barreled outer-membrane protein driven by SecA and ATP becomes much more dependent on the proton-motive force. The activity of the translocating copy of SecYEG may therefore be modulated by association with different accessory subcomplexes: SecYEG (forming SecYEG dimers) or SecDF–YajC–YidC (forming the HTL). This versatility may provide a means to refine the secretion and insertion capabilities according to the substrate. A similar modularity may also be exploited for the translocation or insertion of a wide range of substrates across and into the endoplasmic reticular and mitochondrial membranes of eukaryotes.},

abstract = {ALKBH7 is the mitochondrial AlkB family member which is required for alkylation and oxidation-induced programmed necrosis. In contrast to the protective role of other AlkB family members after suffering alkylation induced DNA damage, ALKBH7 triggers the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and promotes cell death. Moreover, genetic ablation of mouse Alkbh7 dramatically increases body weight and fat mass. Here, we present crystal structures of human ALKBH7 in complex with Mn(II) and $\alpha$-KG at 1.35 {\AA} or N-oxalylglycine at 2.0 {\AA} resolution. ALKBH7 possesses the conserved double-stranded $\beta$-helix (DSBH) fold that coordinates a catalytically active iron by a conserved HXD/E-Xn-H motif. Self-hydroxylation of Leu110 was observed, indicating that ALKBH7 has the potential to catalyze hydroxylation of its substrate. Unlike other AlkB family members whose substrates are DNA or RNA, ALKBH7 is devoid of the 'nucleotide recognition lid' which is essential for binding nucleobases, and thus exhibits a solvent exposed active site; two loops between $\beta$-strands $\beta$6 and $\beta$7, $\beta$9 and $\beta$10 create a special outer wall of the minor $\beta$ sheet of DSBH and form a negatively charged groove. These distinct features suggest that ALKBH7 may act on protein substrate rather than nucleic acids.

abstract = {High abundance proteins like protease inhibitors of plasma display a multitude of interactions in natural environments. Quantitative analysis of such interactions in vivo is essential to study diseases, but have not been forthcoming, as most methods cannot be directly applied in a complex biological environment. Here, we report a quantitative microscale thermophoresis assay capable of deciphering functional deviations from in vitro inhibition data by combining concentration and affinity measurements. We obtained stable measurement signals for the substrate-like interaction of the disease relevant inhibitor $\alpha$-1-antitrypsin (AAT) Z-variant with catalytically inactive elastase. The signal differentiates between healthy and sick AAT-deficient individuals suggesting that affinity between AAT and elastase is strongly modulated by so-far overlooked additional binding partners from the plasma.},

Compared with a complete gold surface, only 40% of the amount of antibodies was bound to the nanospot surface, but structured such that 15-fold higher sensitivity to vital cancer cells was achieved. Human cancer cell lines JEG-3 (lymphoblastic leukemia) and MOLT-17 (placental choriocarcinoma) from cell cultures were successfully detected. The sensor showed significant responses on less than 10 cells injected in a single run. The extreme increase in sensitivity and its simple regeneration emphasizes the usefulness of its introduction in biomedical applications. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Transcription Activator-Like Effectors (TALEs) of Xanthomonas bacteria are programmable DNA binding proteins with unprecedented target specificity. Comparative studies into TALE repeat structure and function are hindered by the limited sequence variation among TALE repeats. More sequence-diverse TALE-like proteins are known from Ralstonia solanacearum (RipTALs) and Burkholderia rhizoxinica (Bats), but RipTAL and Bat repeats are conserved with those of TALEs around the DNA-binding residue. We study two novel marine-organism TALE-like proteins (MOrTL1 and MOrTL2), the first to date of non-terrestrial origin. We have assessed their DNA-binding properties and modelled repeat structures. We found that repeats from these proteins mediate sequence specific DNA binding conforming to the TALE code, despite low sequence similarity to TALE repeats, and with novel residues around the BSR. However, MOrTL1 repeats show greater sequence discriminating power than MOrTL2 repeats. Sequence alignments show that there are only three residues conserved between repeats of all TALE-like proteins including the two new additions. This conserved motif could prove useful as an identifier for future TALE-likes. Additionally, comparing MOrTL repeats with those of other TALE-likes suggests a common evolutionary origin for the TALEs, RipTALs and Bats.},

abstract = {Netrins, a family of laminin-related molecules, have been proposed to act as guidance cues either during nervous system development or the establishment of the vascular system. This was clearly demonstrated for netrin-1 via its interaction with the receptors DCC and UNC5s. However, mainly based on shared homologies with netrin-1, netrin-4 was also proposed to play a role in neuronal outgrowth and developmental/pathological angiogenesis via interactions with netrin-1 receptors. Here, we present the high-resolution structure of netrin-4, which shows unique features in comparison with netrin-1, and show that it does not bind directly to any of the known netrin-1 receptors. We show that netrin-4 disrupts laminin networks and basement membranes (BMs) through high-affinity binding to the laminin gamma1 chain. We hypothesize that this laminin-related function is essential for the previously described effects on axon growth promotion and angiogenesis. Our study unveils netrin-4 as a non-enzymatic extracellular matrix protein actively disrupting pre-existing BMs.},

abstract = {The interaction between the renal water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) and the lysosomal trafficking regulator-interacting protein LIP5 targets AQP2 to multivesicular bodies and facilitates lysosomal degradation. This interaction is part of a process which controls AQP2 apical membrane abundance in a vasopressin-dependent manner, allowing for urine volume adjustment. Vasopressin regulates phosphorylation at four sites within the AQP2 C-terminus (S256, S261, S264, T269), of which S256 is crucial and sufficient for AQP2 translocation from storage vesicles to the apical membrane. However, whether AQP2 phosphorylation modulates AQP2-LIP5 complex affinity is unknown. Here using far-western blot analysis and microscale thermophoresis (MST) to show that the AQP2 binds LIP5 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. We constructed five phospho-mimicking mutants (S256E, S261E, S264E, T269E, S256E/T269E) and a C-terminal truncation mutant (DeltaP242) that lacked all phosphorylation sites but retained a previously suggested LIP5-binding site. CD-spectroscopy indicated that wild-type AQP2 and the phospho-mimicking mutants had similar overall structure but displayed differences in melting temperatures possibly arising from C-terminal conformational changes. Non-phosphorylated AQP2 bound LIP5 with the highest affinity while AQP2-DeltaP242 had 20-fold lower affinity as determined by MST. AQP2-S256E, S261E, T269E and S256E/T269E all had reduced affinity. This effect was most prominent for AQP2-S256E, which fits well with its role in apical membrane targeting. AQP2-S264E had affinity similar to non-phoshorylated AQP2, possibly indicating a role in exosome excretion. Our data suggest that AQP2 phosphorylation allosterically controls its interaction with LIP5, illustrating how altered affinities to interacting proteins forms the basis for regulation of AQP2 trafficking by post-translational modifications.},

@article{Duhr2006a,
abstract = {Molecules drift along temperature gradients, an effect called thermophoresis, the Soret effect, or thermodiffusion. In liquids, its theoretical foundation is the subject of a long-standing debate. By using an all-optical microfluidic fluorescence method, we present experimental results for DNA and polystyrene beads over a large range of particle sizes, salt concentrations, and temperatures. The data support a unifying theory based on solvation entropy. Stated in simple terms, the Soret coefficient is given by the negative solvation entropy, divided by kT. The theory predicts the thermodiffusion of polystyrene beads and DNA without any free parameters. We assume a local thermodynamic equilibrium of the solvent molecules around the molecule. This assumption is fulfilled for moderate temperature gradients below a fluctuation criterion. For both DNA and polystyrene beads, thermophoretic motion changes sign at lower temperatures. This thermophilicity toward lower temperatures is attributed to an increasing positive entropy of hydration, whereas the generally dominating thermophobicity is explained by the negative entropy of ionic shielding. The understanding of thermodiffusion sets the stage for detailed probing of solvation properties of colloids and biomolecules. For example, we successfully determine the effective charge of DNA and beads over a size range that is not accessible with electrophoresis.},

abstract = {During Erwinia chrysanthemi L-asparaginase (ErA) manufacture, minor conformational variants are formed that elute in the acidic region of the analytical ion-exchange HPLC chromatogram. These variants retain enzymatic activity and form part of the biopharmaceutical product, but must be kept within acceptable limits through controlled operation of the manufacturing process. The high isoelectric point of the ErA native tetramer (8.6) leads to certain process steps being operated in the alkaline pH region. Previously, the formation of these species during processing was not fully understood. In this work, in-process samples were analysed, and alkaline pH (8–9) and hold time were found to be the governing parameters. Formation of ErA acidic species was found to be accelerated at higher pH values and longer hold times, suggesting potential control strategies for the manufacturing process. However, the kinetics of ErA conformational variant formation were found to be slow (0.15–0.25 percent per day at pH 8.5). Changes in the ErA melt temperature (Tm) with pH as determined by both differential scanning calorimetry and differential scanning fluorimetry were found to be predictive of the tendency to form the IEX-HPLC acidic species during processing. Biopharmaceutical process developers should be aware of such changes to proteins and build relevant control strategies into process validation plans.},

abstract = {The enzyme protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR, EC 1.3.1.33) has a key role in plant development. It catalyzes one of the later steps in chlorophyll synthesis, the light-induced reduction of protochlorophyllide (PChlide) into chlorophyllide (Chlide) in the presence of NADPH. Two isozymes of plant POR, POR A and POR B from barley, which differ in their function during plant life, are compared with respect to their substrate binding affinity, catalytic efficiency, and catalytic mechanism. POR B as compared to POR A shows an 5-fold higher binding affinity for protochlorophyllide a (PChlide) and an about 6-fold higher catalytic efficiency measured as ratio kcat/KM. Based on the reaction intermediates, which can be trapped at low temperatures the same reaction mechanism operates in both POR A and POR B. In contrast to results reported for POR enzymes from cyanobacteria, the initial light-driven step, which occurs at temperatures below 180 K already involves the full chemistry of the photoreduction and yields the reaction product, Chlide, in an enzyme-bound form. The subsequent dark reactions, which include cofactor (NADP+) release and cofactor (NADPH) rebinding, show different temperature dependencies for POR A and POR B and suggest a higher conformational flexibility of POR B in the surrounding of the active center. Both the higher substrate binding affinity and well-adapted enzyme dynamics are held responsible for the increased catalytic activity of POR B as compared to POR A.},

abstract = {One of the most important parameters in the development of therapeutic biologics is their long-term stability. While after purification being seemingly stable in a variety of formulations, many antibodies display very slow aggregation kinetics over time. This gradual aggregation could thus far only be evaluated by monitoring monomer contents and aggregates over months or even years. Predictive methods are therefore urgently needed to speed up the development of biologics. Here we demonstrate that the Prometheus NT.Plex by NanoTemper Technologies can be used for predicting long-term stability in only a few hours. The approach uses a combination of thermal and chemical unfolding analysis in a high-throughput setting. We show that chemical denaturation is a tool which can determine folding enthalpies of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to predict their long-term stability in formulation screenings. Using the Prometheus NT.Plex nanoDSF instrument with aggregation detection optics, we screened 5 formulations at different mAb concentrations for their thermal and chemical stability. The obtained unfolding data correlates with long-term turbidity and monomer content over time, showing that the Prometheus NT.Plex can be used to rapidly predict the long-term stability of biologics within 1 day.},

abstract = {Components of the chromatin remodelling SWI/SNF complex are recurrently mutated in tumours, suggesting that altering the activity of the complex plays a role in oncogenesis. However, the role that the individual subunits play in this process is not clear. We set out to develop an inhibitor compound targeting the bromodomain of BRD9 in order to evaluate its function within the SWI/SNF complex. Here, we present the discovery and development of a potent and selective BRD9 bromodomain inhibitor series based on a new pyridinone-like scaffold. Crystallographic information of the inhibitors bound to BRD9 guided their development with respect to potency for BRD9 and selectivity against BRD4. These compounds modulate BRD9 bromodomain cellular function and display anti-tumour activity in an AML xenograft model. Two chemical probes, BI-7273 (1) and BI-9564 (2), were identified that should prove useful in further exploring BRD9 bromodomain biology in both in vitro and in vivo settings.},

abstract = {Understanding the molecular interactions between small molecules and double-stranded DNA has important implications on the design and development of DNA and DNA-protein nanomaterials. Such materials can be assembled into a vast array of 1-, 2-, and 3D structures that contain a range of chemical and physical features where small molecules can bind via intercalation, groove binding, and electrostatics. In this work, we use a series of simulation-guided binding assays and spectroscopy techniques to investigate the binding of selected organophosphtates, methyl parathion, paraoxon, their common enzyme hydrolysis product p-nitrophenol, and double-stranded DNA fragments and DNA DX tiles, a basic building block of DNA-based materials. Docking simulations suggested that the binding strength of each compound was DNA sequence-dependent, with dissociation constants in the micromolar range. Microscale thermophoresis and fluorescence binding assays confirmed sequence-dependent binding and that paraoxon bound to DNA with Kd's between ∼10 and 300 $\mu$M, while methyl parathion bound with Kd's between ∼10 and 100 $\mu$M. p-Nitrophenol also bound to DNA but with affinities up to 650 $\mu$M. Changes in biding affinity were due to changes in binding mode as revealed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Based on these results, two DNA DX tiles were constructed and analyzed, revealing tighter binding to the studied compounds. Taken together, the results presented here add to our fundamental understanding of the molecular interactions of these compounds with biological materials and opens new possibilities in DNA-based sensors, DNA-based matrices for organophosphate extraction, and enzyme-DNA technologies for organophosphate hydrolysis.},

The novel aptamers are structurally analogous to the well-known thrombin-inhibiting G-quadruplexes TBA15 and TBA31. The secondary structure stability, binding affinity for thrombin and anticoagulant effects of the triazole-modified aptamers were measured. A modification in the central loop of the aptamer quadruplex resulted in increased nuclease resistance and an inhibition efficiency similar to that of TBA15. The likely aptamer-thrombin binding mode was determined by molecular dynamics simulations. Due to their relatively high activity and the increased resistance to nuclease digestion imparted by the triazole internucleotide linkages, the novel aptamers are a promising alternative to known DNA-based anticoagulant agents.},

abstract = {Biotransformations in organic chemistry frequently suffer from limitations caused by low water-solubility of substrates and product inhibition. Both, usually are addressed by the addition of organic cosolvents, which often accompanies at the expense of enzyme stability. A common method for measuring enzyme stability is to determine the melting temperature (Tm) of the enzyme. However, current methods are limited to the application of purified enzymes. Herein, for the first time, an easy and fast (<1 h) high-throughput feasible method to determine enzyme stabilities directly from crude extracts is reported. In pure buffer, the Tm value measured in the crude extract was identical to that obtained for the purified enzyme. Through the addition of different organic compounds, the Tm values in the crude extract differed by up to 2.4 8C from that of the purified enzymes due to the presence of the host-cell proteins. Thus, the measurement of enzyme stabilities in crude extracts appears to represent conditions in whole-cell catalysts even better. The applied nano differential scanning fluorimetry technology is further proven to be suitable for whole-cell catalysts with two overexpressed enzymes; thus representing a tool for the rapid screening of natural and mutant enzyme libraries in terms of process stability for challenging biotransformations.},

abstract = {Summary srGAP proteins regulate cell migration and morphogenesis by shaping the structure and dynamics of the cytoskeleton and membranes. First discovered as intracellular effectors for the Robo1 axon-guidance receptor, srGAPs were later identified as interacting with several other nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. In all these cases, the srGAP SH3 domain mediates protein-protein interactions by recognizing a short proline-rich segment on the cognate-binding partner. However, as interactions between the isolated SH3 domain and a selected set of ligands show weak affinity and low specificity, it is not clear how srGAPs are precisely recruited to their signaling sites. Here, we report a two-component molecular mechanism that regulates ligand binding to srGAP2 by on the one hand dramatically tightening their association and on the other, moderately autoinhibiting and restricting binding. Our results allow the design of point mutations for better probing of srGAP2 activities, and may facilitate the identification of new srGAP2 ligands.},

Microtubule polymers disrupted this interaction. In cells, MPS1 binding to kinetochores or to ectopic NDC80 complexes was prevented by end-on microtubule attachment, independent of known kinetochore protein-removal mechanisms. Competition for kinetochore binding between SAC proteins and microtubules provides a direct and perhaps evolutionarily conserved way to detect a properly organized spindle ready for cell division.},

abstract = {Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domains are essential modules of many multi-domain signalling proteins that mediate protein interaction and/or sense environmental stimuli. Frequently, multiple PAS domains are present within single polypeptide chains, where their interplay is required for protein function. Although many isolated PAS domain structures have been reported over the last decades, only a few structures of multi-PAS proteins are known. Therefore, the molecular mechanism of multi-PAS domain-mediated protein oligomerization and function is poorly understood. The transcription factor PpsR from Rhodobacter sphaeroides is such a multi-PAS domain protein that, in addition to its three PAS domains, contains a glutamine-rich linker and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. Here, crystal structures of two N-terminally and C-terminally truncated PpsR variants that comprise a single (PpsRQ-PAS1) and two (PpsRN-Q-PAS1) PAS domains, respectively, are presented and the multi-step strategy required for the phasing of a triple PAS domain construct (PpsR$\Delta$HTH) is illustrated. While parts of the biologically relevant dimerization interface can already be observed in the two shorter constructs, the PpsR$\Delta$HTH structure reveals how three PAS domains enable the formation of multiple oligomeric states (dimer, tetramer and octamer), highlighting that not only the PAS cores but also their $\alpha$-helical extensions are essential for protein oligomerization. The results demonstrate that the long helical glutamine-rich linker of PpsR results from a direct fusion of the N-cap of the PAS1 domain with the C-terminal extension of the N-domain that plays an important role in signal transduction.},

VERL repeats fold like the functionally essential N-terminal repeat of mammalian sperm receptor ZP2, whose structure is also described here. Whereas sequence-divergent repeat 1 does not bind lysin, repeat 3 binds it non-species specifically via a high-affinity, largely hydrophobic interface. Due to its intermediate binding affinity, repeat 2 selectively interacts with lysin from the same species. Exposure of a highly positively charged surface of VERL-bound lysin suggests that complex formation both disrupts the organization of egg coat filaments and triggers their electrostatic repulsion, thereby opening a hole for sperm penetration and fusion.},

Cprot possesses 8.2% $\alpha$-helix, 31.1% $\beta$-sheet and 23.8% turns. The enzyme was found to be active over a wide pH range and up to 55 °C. The protease was also stable in organic solvents up to 50% (v/v) concentration of alcohols and DMSO for >24 h and in 2 M guanidine hydrochloride for >12 h. Cprot was also resistant to trypsin, chymotrypsin, proteinase K and fluorinated alcohols (5–10%). The melting temperatures observed for the native Cprot and for the enzyme treated under various stress conditions correlated well with the corresponding structural and functional transitions obtained. The structural information was supported by the homology model of its closest homologue from C. coronatus; revealing its similarity to PA clan of proteases (Proteases of mixed nucleophile, superfamily A), with His-64, Asp-113 and Ser-208 as putative catalytic triad.

abstract = {The detergents used to solubilize GPCRs can make crystal growth the rate-limiting step in determining their structure. The Kobilka laboratory showed that insertion of T4-lysozyme (T4L) in the 3rd intracellular loop is a promising strategy towards increasing the solvent-exposed receptor area, and hence the number of possible lattice-forming contacts. The potential to use T4L with the olfactory-related receptors hOR17-4 and hVN1R1 was thus tested. The structure and function of native and T4L-variants were compared. Both receptors localized to the cell membrane, and could initiate ligand-activated signaling. Purified receptors not only had the predicted alpha-helical structures, but also bound their ligands canthoxal (MW = 178.23) and myrtenal (MW = 150.22). Interestingly, the T4L variants had higher percentages of soluble monomers compared to protein aggregates, effectively increasing the protein yield that could be used for structural and function studies. They also bound their ligands for longer times, suggesting higher receptor stability. Our results indicate that a T4L insertion may be a general method for obtaining GPCRs suitable for structural studies.},

abstract = {Ras proteins are small GTPases that act as signal transducers between cell surface receptors and several intracellular signaling cascades. They contain highly homologous catalytic domains and flexible C-terminal hypervariable regions (HVRs) that differ across Ras isoforms. KRAS is among the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human tumors. Surprisingly, we found that the C-terminal HVR of K-Ras4B, thought to minimally impact the catalytic domain, directly interacts with the active site of the protein. The interaction is almost 100-fold tighter with the GDP-bound than the GTP-bound protein. HVR binding interferes with Ras-Raf interaction, modulates binding to phospholipids, and slightly slows down nucleotide exchange. The data indicate that contrary to previously suggested models of K-Ras4B signaling, HVR plays essential roles in regulation of signaling. High affinity binding of short peptide analogs of HVR to K-Ras active site suggests that targeting this surface with inhibitory synthetic molecules for the therapy of KRAS-dependent tumors is feasible.},

abstract = {A thermal unfolding based assay using low volume differential intrinsic tryptophan scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) was applied to study the stabilizing effects of ligands on G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are the fourth largest superfamily in the human genome and are the largest class of targets for drug discovery. The system has been validated using human adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR). A2AR binds natural (adenosine and caffeine) and synthetic ligands with different affinities to mediate a variety of physiological and pharmacological responses. Several well- characterized ligands were used for the unfolding experiments. The $\Delta$Tm shift values obtained from nanoDSF analysis and traditional ligand binding studies correlate well with each other. We further characterized a second human GPCR target (test-GPCR) for which traditional cysteine-reactive DSF has been problematic. nanoDSF demonstrated that small molecule ligands can stabilize the detergent-solubilized receptor, thus showing the target GPCR is active in a selected detergent and lipid-free environment. In addition, we report a buffer composition screen to further stabilize the receptor in its detergent environment for biophysical assays. Based on our results, we show that the nanoDSF technology will allow the development of an automated screening platform in a label-free environment to evaluate a large number of compounds for lead discovery and to improve receptor stability for biophysical assays by screening buffer conditions.},

abstract = {During telophase, the nuclear envelope (NE) reforms around daughter nuclei to ensure proper segregation of nuclear and cytoplasmic contents. NE reformation requires the coating of chromatin by membrane derived from the endoplasmic reticulum, and a subsequent annular fusion step to ensure that the formed envelope is sealed. How annular fusion is accomplished is unknown, but it is thought to involve the p97 AAA-ATPase complex and bears a topological equivalence to the membrane fusion event that occurs during the abscission phase of cytokinesis. Here we show that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport-III (ESCRT-III) machinery localizes to sites of annular fusion in the forming NE in human cells, and is necessary for proper post-mitotic nucleo-cytoplasmic compartmentalization. The ESCRT-III component charged multivesicular body protein 2A (CHMP2A) is directed to the forming NE through binding to CHMP4B, and provides an activity essential for NE reformation. Localization also requires the p97 complex member ubiquitin fusion and degradation 1 (UFD1). Our results describe a novel role for the ESCRT machinery in cell division and demonstrate a conservation of the machineries involved in topologically equivalent mitotic membrane remodelling events.},

As the promise of FBDD strategies becomes increasingly realized, now is an opportune time to draw lessons and point the way to the future.

Measurements of protein unfolding transitions are widely employed for comparing candidate molecules and formulations; however, the interrelationships between intrinsic protein conformational stability and pharmaceutical robustness are complex and thermal unfolding measurements can be misleading. Beyond the discovery phase of drug development, astute formulation design is one of the most crucial factors enabling the protein to resist damage to its higher order structure - initially from bioprocessing stresses, then from stresses encountered during its journey from the product manufacturing site to the bloodstream of the patient. Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are multidomain proteins that represent a large and growing segment of the biotechnology pipeline. In this chapter, we describe how differential scanning calorimetry may be leveraged synergistically with isothermal chemical denaturation and intrinsic fluorescence with concomitant static light scattering to elucidate characteristics of mAb unfolding and aggregation that are helpful toward understanding and designing optimal pharmaceutical compositions for these molecules.},

Using non-denaturing mass spectrometry, we show that McjD in complex with MccJ25 survives the gas phase. Partial delipidation of McjD resulted in reduced ATPase activity and thermostability as shown by circular dichroism, both of which could be restored upon addition of defined E. coli lipids. We have resolved a phosphatidylglycerol lipid associated with McjD at 3.4 {\AA} resolution, whereas molecular dynamic simulations carried out in different lipid environments assessed the binding of specific lipids to McjD. Combined, our data show a synergistic effect of zwitterionic and negatively charged lipids on the activity of McjD; the zwitterionic lipids provide structural stability to McjD, whereas the negatively charged lipids are essential for its function.},

When investigated by super-resolution imaging, the nanobodies revealed substantial extra-synaptic populations for both SNAP-25 and Syntaxin 1A, which were poorly detected by antibodies. Moreover, extra-synaptic Syntaxin 1A molecules were recruited to synapses during stimulation, suggesting that these are physiologically-active molecules.

We apply differential scanning fluorimetry in combination with scattering upon thermal denaturation to study the unfolding of integral membrane proteins. Nine different prokaryotic and eukaryotic membrane proteins were used as test cases to benchmark our detergent screening method. Our results show that it is possible to measure the stability and solubility of IMPs by diluting them from their initial solubilization condition into different detergents. We were able to identify groups of detergents with characteristic stabilization and destabilization effects for selected targets. We further show that fos-choline and PEG family detergents may lead to membrane protein destabilization and unfolding. Finally, we determined thenmodynamic parameters that are important indicators of IMP stability. The described protocol allows the identification of conditions that are suitable for downstream handling of membrane proteins during purification.},

abstract = {CXCL14, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 14, is a novel highly conserved chemokine with unique features. Despite exhibiting the typical chemokine fold, it has a very short N-terminus of just two amino acid residues responsible for chemokine receptor activation. CXCL14 actively participates in homeostatic immune surveillance of skin and mucosae, is linked to metabolic disorders, fibrotic lung diseases, and possesses strong anti-angiogenic properties in early tumor development. In this work, we investigated the interaction of CXCL14 with various glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) by NMR spectroscopy, microscale thermophoresis, analytical heparin affinity chromatography, and in silico approaches to understand the molecular basis of GAG-binding. We observed different GAG binding modes specific for the GAG type used in the study. In particular, the CXCL14 epitope for heparin suggests a binding pose distinguishable from the ones of the other GAGs investigated (hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate-A/C, -D, dermatan sulfate. This observation is also supported by computational methods that included molecular docking, molecular dynamics and free energy calculations. Based on our results, we suggest that distinct GAG sulfation patterns confer specificity beyond simple electrostatic interactions usually considered to represent the driving forces in protein-GAG interactions. The CXCL14-GAG system represents a promising approach to investigate the specificity of GAG protein interactions, which represents an important topic for developing the rational approaches to novel strategies in regenerative medicine.},

abstract = {Scaffolding proteins play important roles in supporting the plasma membrane (sarcolemma) of muscle cells. Among them, dystrophin strengthens the sarcolemma through protein-lipid interactions, and its absence due to gene mutations leads to the severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Most of the dystrophin protein consists of a central domain made of 24 spectrin- like coiled-coil repeats (R). Using small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and the contrast variation technique, we specifically probed the structure of the three first consecutive repeats 1–3 (R1–3), a part of dystrophin known to physiologically interact with membrane lipids. R1–3 free in solution was compared to its structure adopted in the presence of phospholipid-based bicelles. SANS data for the protein/lipid complexes were obtained with contrast-matched bicelles under various phospholipid compositions to probe the role of electrostatic interactions. When bound to anionic bicelles, large modifications of the protein threedimensional structure were detected, as revealed by a significant increase of the protein gyration radius from 42 5 1 to 60 5 4 A° . R1–3/anionic bicelle complexes were further analyzed by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. From these studies, we report an all-atom model of R1–3 that highlights the opening of the R1 coiled-coil repeat when bound to the membrane lipids. This model is totally in agreement with SANS and click chemistry/mass spectrometry data. We conclude that the sarcolemma membrane anchoring that occurs during the contraction/elongation process of muscles could be ensured by this coiled-coil opening. Therefore, understanding these structural changes may help in the design of rationalized shortened dystrophins for gene therapy. Finally, our strategy opens up new possibilities for structure determination of peripheral and integral membrane proteins not compatible with different high-resolution structural methods.},

abstract = {The establishment of nitrogen-fixing root nodules in legume–rhizobia symbiosis requires an intricate communication between the host plant and its symbiont. We are, however, limited in our understanding of the symbiosis signaling process. In particular, how membrane-localized receptors of legumes activate signal transduction following perception of rhizobial signaling molecules has mostly remained elusive. To address this, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation-based proteomics screen to identify proteins associated with Nod factor receptor 5 (NFR5) in Lotus japonicus. Out of 51 NFR5-associated proteins, we focused on a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK), which we named NFR5- interacting cytoplasmic kinase 4 (NiCK4). NiCK4 associates with heterologously expressed NFR5 in Nicotiana benthamiana, and directly binds and phosphorylates the cytoplasmic domains of NFR5 and NFR1 in vitro. At the cellular level, Nick4 is coexpressed with Nfr5 in root hairs and nodule cells, and the NiCK4 protein relocates to the nucleus in an NFR5/NFR1-dependent manner upon Nod factor treatment. Phenotyping of retrotransposon insertion mutants revealed that NiCK4 promotes nodule organogenesis. Together, these results suggest that the identified RLCK, NiCK4, acts as a component of the Nod factor signaling pathway downstream of NFR5.},

abstract = {2',3'-cAMP is an intriguing small molecule that is conserved among different kingdoms. 2',3'-cAMP is presumably produced during RNA degradation, with increased cellular levels observed especially under stress conditions. Previously, we observed the presence of 2',3'-cAMP in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) protein complexes isolated from native lysate, suggesting that 2',3'-cAMP has potential protein partners in plants. Here, affinity purification experiments revealed that 2',3'-cAMP associates with the stress granule (SG) proteome. SGs are aggregates composed of protein and mRNA, which enable cells to selectively store mRNA for use in response to stress such as heat whereby translation initiation is impaired. Using size-exclusion chromatography and affinity purification analyses, we identified Rbp47b, the key component of SGs, as a potential interacting partner of 2',3'-cAMP. Furthermore, SG formation was promoted in 2',3'-cAMP-treated Arabidopsis seedlings, and interactions between 2',3'-cAMP and RNA-binding domains of Rbp47b, RRM2 and RRM3, were confirmed in vitro using microscale thermophoresis. Taken together, these results (1) describe novel small-molecule regulation of SG formation, (2) provide evidence for the biological role of 2',3'-cAMP, and (3) demonstrate an original biochemical pipeline for the identification of protein-metabolite interactors.},

abstract = {SecB chaperones assist protein export by binding both unfolded proteins and the SecA motor. Certain SecB homologs can also control toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems known to modulate bacterial growth in response to stress. In such TA-chaperone (TAC) systems, SecB assists the folding and prevents degradation of the antitoxin, thus facilitating toxin inhibition. Chaperone dependency is conferred by a C-terminal extension in the antitoxin known as chaperone addiction (ChAD) sequence, which makes the antitoxin aggregation-prone and prevents toxin inhibition. Using TAC of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we present the structure of a SecB-like chaperone bound to its ChAD peptide. We find differences in the binding interfaces when compared to SecB–SecA or SecB-preprotein complexes, and show that the antitoxin can reach a functional form while bound to the chaperone. This work reveals how chaperones can use discrete surface binding regions to accommodate different clients or partners and thereby expand their substrate repertoire and functions.},

The crystal structure of the MORC3 region encompassing the ATPase and CW domains in complex with a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog demonstrates that the two domains are directly coupled.

MORC3 autoinhibition is released by disrupting the intramolecular ATPase:CW coupling through the competitive interaction of CW with histone H3 tail or by mutating the interfacial residues. Binding of CW to H3 leads to a marked rearrangement in the ATPase-CW cassette, which frees the DNA-binding site in active MORC3 (on state). We show that ATP-induced dimerization of the ATPase domain is strictly required for the catalytic activity and that the dimeric form of ATPase-CW might cooperatively bind to dsDNA. Together, our findings uncovered a mechanism underlying the fine-tuned regulation of the catalytic domain of MORC3 by the epigenetic reader, CW.},

abstract = {The plant hormone ethylene is a key regulator of plant growth, development and stress adaption. Ethylene perception and response are mediated by a family of integral membrane receptors (ETRs) localized at the ER-Golgi network. The biological function of these receptors relies on a protein-bound copper cofactor. Nonetheless, molecular processes and structures controlling assembly and integration of the metal into the functional plant hormone receptor are still unknown. Here, we have explored the molecular pathways of copper transfer from the plant cytosol to the ethylene receptor family by analyzing protein–protein interactions of receptors with soluble and membrane-bound plant copper carriers. Our results suggest that receptors primarily acquire their metal cofactor from copper transporter RESPONSIVE-TO-ANTAGONIST-1 (RAN1) which has been loaded with the transition metal beforehand by soluble copper carriers of the ATX1-family. In addition, we found evidence for a direct interaction of ETRs with soluble chaperones ANTIOXIDANT-1 (ATX1) and COPPER TRANSPORT PROTEIN (CCH) raising the possibility of a direct copper exchange between soluble chaperones and receptors.},

abstract = {Phosphorus acquisition is critical for life. In low phosphate conditions, some species of bacteria have evolved mechanisms to import reduced phosphorus compounds, such as phosphite and hypophosphite, as alternative phosphorus sources. Uptake is facilitated by high-affinity periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) that bind cargo in the periplasm and shuttle it to an ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-transporter in the bacterial inner membrane. PtxB and HtxB are the PBPs responsible for binding phosphite and hypophosphite, respectively. They recognize the P-H bond of phosphite/hypophosphite via a conserved P-H...$\pi$ interaction, which confers nanomolar dissociation constants for their respective ligands. PtxB also has a low-level binding affinity for phosphate and hypophosphite, whilst HtxB can facilitate phosphite uptake in vivo. However, HtxB does not bind phosphate, thus the HtxBCDE transporter has recently been successfully exploited for biocontainment of genetically modified organisms by phosphite-dependent growth. Here we use a combination of X-ray crystallography, NMR and Microscale Thermophoresis to show that phosphite binding to HtxB depends on the protonation state of the ligand, suggesting that pH may effect the efficiency of phosphite uptake by HtxB in biotechnology applications.},

Here we describe an affinity purification (AP) approach in combination with LC/MS-based metabolomics and proteomics that allows, to our knowledge for the first time, analysis of protein-metabolite and protein-protein interactions simultaneously in plant systems. More specifically, we examined protein and small-molecule partners of the three (of five) nucleoside diphosphate kinases present in the Arabidopsis genome (NDPK1-NDPK3). The bona fide role of NDPKs is the exchange of terminal phosphate groups between nucleoside diphosphates (NDPs) and triphosphates (NTPs). However, other functions have been reported, which probably depend on both the proteins and small molecules specifically interacting with the NDPK. Using our approach we identified 23, 17, and 8 novel protein partners of NDPK1, NDPK2, and NDPK3, respectively, with nucleotide-dependent proteins such as actin and adenosine kinase 2 being enriched. Particularly interesting, however, was the co-elution of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and reduced glutathione (GSH) with the affinity-purified NDPK1 complexes. Following up on this finding, we could demonstrate that NDPK1 undergoes glutathionylation, opening a new paradigm of NDPK regulation in plants. The described results extend our knowledge of NDPKs, the key enzymes regulating NDP/NTP homeostasis.},

Although these interactions affect cellular metabolism, growth, and development, they have been largely understudied. Herein, we describe a method, which we named PROtein–Metabolite Interactions using Size separation (PROMIS), that allows simultaneous, global analysis of endogenous protein–small molecule and of protein–protein complexes. To this end, a cell-free native lysate from Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography, followed by quantitative metabolomic and proteomic analyses. Proteins and small molecules showing similar elution behavior, across protein-containing fractions, constituted putative interactors. Applying PROMIS to an A. thaliana extract, we ascertained known protein– protein (PPIs) and protein–metabolite (PMIs) interactions and reproduced binding between small-molecule protease inhibitors and their respective proteases. More importantly, we present examples of two experimental strategies that exploit the PROMIS dataset to identify novel PMIs. By looking for similar elution behavior of metabolites and enzymes belonging to the same biochemical pathways, we identified putative feedback and feed-forward regulations in pantothenate biosynthesis and the methionine salvage cycle, respectively. By combining PROMIS with an orthogonal affinity purification approach, we identified an interaction between the dipeptide Tyr–Asp and the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. In summary, we present proof of concept for a powerful experimental tool that enables system-wide analysis of PMIs and PPIs across all biological systems. The dataset obtained here comprises nearly 140 metabolites and 5000 proteins, which can be mined for putative interactors.},

MYC is strictly dependent on heterodimerization with MAX for transcription activation. Aiming at targeting this interaction, we identified MYCMI-6 in a cell-based protein interaction screen for small inhibitory molecules. MYCMI-6 exhibits strong selective inhibition of MYC:MAX interaction in cells and in vitro at single-digit micromolar concentrations, as validated by split Gaussia luciferase, in situ proximity ligation, microscale thermophoresis and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. Further, MYCMI-6 blocks MYC-driven transcription and binds selectively to the MYC bHLHZip domain with a KD of 1.6 ± 0.5 $\mu$M as demonstrated by SPR. MYCMI-6 inhibits tumor cell growth in a MYC-dependent manner with IC50 concentrations as low as 0.5 $\mu$M, while sparing normal cells. The response to MYCMI-6 correlates with MYC expression based on data from 60 human tumor cell lines and is abrogated by MYC depletion.

abstract = {Introduction: Drug plasma protein binding remains highly relevant to research and drug development, making the assessment and profiling of compound affinity to plasma proteins essential to drug discovery efforts. Although there are a number of fully-characterized methods, they lack the throughput to handle large numbers of compounds. As the evaluation of adsorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion is addressed earlier in the drug development timeline, the need for higher-throughput methods has grown. Areas Covered: This review will highlight recent developments on methods for profiling drug plasma binding, with an emphasis on fluorescent probes and emerging high-throughput methodologies. Expert Opinion: There have been a number of high-throughput assays developed in recent years to meet the scaled up demands for compound profiling. Ultimately, the selection of assay technology relies on a number of factors, such as capabilities of the laboratory and the breadth and amount of data required. Fluorescent probe displacement assays are highly flexible and amenable to high-throughput screening, easily scaling up to handle large compound libraries. Recent developments in fluorescence technologies, such as homogenous time-resolved fluorescence and probes utilizing the aggregation-induced emission effect, have improved the sensitivity of these assays. Other technologies, such as microscale thermophoresis and quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling, are gaining popularity as alternative techniques for drug plasma protein binding characterization.},

abstract = {Striga hermonthica is a root parasitic plant that infests cereals, decimating yields, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. For germination, Striga seeds require host-released strigolactones that are perceived by the family of HYPOSENSITIVE to LIGHT (ShHTL) receptors. Inhibiting seed germination would thus be a promising approach for combating Striga However, there are currently no strigolactone antagonists that specifically block ShHTLs and do not bind to DWARF14, the homologous strigolactone receptor of the host. Here, we show that the octyl phenol ethoxylate Triton X-100 inhibits S. hermonthica seed germination without affecting host plants. High-resolution X-ray structures reveal that Triton X-100 specifically plugs the catalytic pocket of ShHTL7. ShHTL7-specific inhibition by Triton X-100 demonstrates the dominant role of this particular ShHTL receptor for Striga germination. Our structural analysis provides a rationale for the broad specificity and high sensitivity of ShHTL7, and reveals that strigolactones trigger structural changes in ShHTL7 that are required for downstream signaling. Our findings identify Triton and the related 2-[4-(2,4,4-trimethylpentan-2-yl)phenoxy]acetic acid as promising lead compounds for the rational design of efficient Striga-specific herbicides.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and, after age, the greatest risk factor for developing AD is the allelic variation of apolipoprotein E (ApoE), with homozygote carriers of the ApoE4 allele having an up to 12-fold greater risk of developing AD than noncarriers. Apolipoprotein E exists as three isoforms that differ in only two amino acid sites, ApoE2 (Cys112/Cys158), ApoE3 (Cys112/Arg158), and ApoE4 (Arg112/Arg158). These amino acid substitutions are assumed to alter ApoE structure and function, and be responsible for the detrimental effects of ApoE4 via a mechanism that remains unclear. The hypothesis that a structural difference between ApoE4 and ApoE3 (and ApoE2) is the cause of the ApoE4-associated increased risk for AD forms the basis of a therapeutic approach to modulate ApoE4 structure, and we were therefore interested in screening to identify new chemical probes for ApoE4. In this regard, a high-yield protocol was developed for the expression and purification of recombinant full-length ApoE, and three diverse biophysical screening assays were established and characterized; an optical label-free assay (Corning Epic) for hit identification and microscale thermophoresis (MST) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) as orthogonal assays for hit confirmation. The 707 compounds in the National Institute of Health clinical collection were screened for binding to ApoE4, from which six confirmed hits, as well as one analogue, were identified. Although the compounds did not differentiate between ApoE isoforms, these data nevertheless demonstrate the feasibility of using a biophysical approach to identifying compounds that bind to ApoE and that, with further optimization, might differentiate between isoforms to produce a molecule that selectively alters the function of ApoE4.},

abstract = {The extreme durability of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) debris has rendered it a long-term environmental burden. At the same time, current recycling efforts still lack sustainability. Two recently discovered bacterial enzymes that specifically degrade PET represent a promising solution. First, Ideonella sakaiensis PETase, a structurally well-characterized consensus $\alpha$/$\beta$-hydrolase fold enzyme, converts PET to mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET). MHETase, the second key enzyme, hydrolyzes MHET to the PET educts terephthalate and ethylene glycol. Here, we report the crystal structures of active ligand-free MHETase and MHETase bound to a nonhydrolyzable MHET analog. MHETase, which is reminiscent of feruloyl esterases, possesses a classic $\alpha$/$\beta$-hydrolase domain and a lid domain conferring substrate specificity. In the light of structure-based mapping of the active site, activity assays, mutagenesis studies and a first structure-guided alteration of substrate specificity towards bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) reported here, we anticipate MHETase to be a valuable resource to further advance enzymatic plastic degradation.},

abstract = {Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) constitute a superfamily of NAD(P)+-dependent enzymes, which detoxify aldehydes produced in various metabolic pathways to the corresponding carboxylic acids. Among the 19 human ALDHs, the cytosolic ALDH9A1 has so far never been fully enzymatically characterized and its structure is still unknown. Here, we report complete molecular and kinetic properties of human ALDH9A1 as well as three crystal forms at 2.3, 2.9, and 2.5 ˚A resolution. We show that ALDH9A1 exhibits wide substrate specificity to aminoaldehydes, aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes with a clear preference for $\gamma$-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde (TMABAL). The structure of ALDH9A1 reveals that the enzyme assembles as a tetramer. Each ALDH monomer displays a typical ALDHs fold composed of an oligomerization domain, a coenzyme domain, a catalytic domain, and an inter-domain linker highly conserved in amino-acid sequence and folding. Nonetheless, structural comparison reveals a position and a fold of the inter-domain linker of ALDH9A1 never observed in any other ALDH so far. This unique difference is not compatible with the presence of a bound substrate and a large conformational rearrangement of the linker up to 30 ˚A has to occur to allow the access of the substrate channel. Moreover, the $\alpha$$\beta$E region consisting of an $\alpha$-helix and a $\beta$-strand of the coenzyme domain at the dimer interface are disordered, likely due to the loss of interactions with the inter-domain linker, which leads to incomplete $\beta$-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) binding pocket.

To evaluate the potential biotechnical value of these proteins, the analysis of protein structures and functions is a central challenge in this program. The stability of protein sample is essential to provide meaningful assay results and increase the crystallizability of the targets. The thermal shift assay (TSA), a fluorescence-based technique, is established as a popular method for optimizing the conditions for protein stability in high-throughput. In TSAs, the employed fluorophores are extrinsic, environmentally-sensitive dyes. An alternative, similar technique is nano differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF), which relies on protein native fluorescence. We present here a novel osmolyte screen, a 96-condition screen of organic additives designed to guide crystallization trials through preliminary TSA experiments. Together with previously-developed pH and salt screens, the set of three screens provides a comprehensive analysis of protein stability in a wide range of buffer systems and additives. The utility of the screens is demonstrated in the TSA and nanoDSF analysis of lysozyme and Protein X, a target protein of the Virus-X project.},

abstract = {Virophages have the unique property of parasitizing giant viruses within unicellular hosts. Little is understood about how they form infectious virions in this tripartite interplay. We provide mechanistic insights into assembly and maturation of mavirus, a marine virophage, by combining structural and stability studies on capsomers, virus-like particles (VLPs), and native virions. We found that the mavirus protease processes the double jelly-roll (DJR) major capsid protein (MCP) at multiple C-terminal sites and that these sites are conserved among virophages. Mavirus MCP assembled in Escherichia coli in the absence and presence of penton protein, forming VLPs with defined size and shape. While quantifying VLPs in E. coli lysates, we found that full-length rather than processed MCP is the competent state for capsid assembly. Full-length MCP was thermally more labile than truncated MCP, and crystal structures of both states indicate that full-length MCP has an expanded DJR core. Thus, we propose that the MCP C-terminal domain serves as a scaffolding domain by adding strain on MCP to confer assembly competence. Mavirus protease processed MCP more efficiently after capsid assembly, which provides a regulation mechanism for timing capsid maturation. By analogy to Sputnik and adenovirus, we propose that MCP processing renders mavirus particles infection competent by loosening interactions between genome and capsid shell and destabilizing pentons for genome release into host cells. The high structural similarity of mavirus and Sputnik capsid proteins together with conservation of protease and MCP processing suggest that assembly and maturation mechanisms described here are universal for virophages.},

abstract = {Label-free differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) is a relatively new method for evaluating the stability of proteins. It can be used as a screening tool for downstream applications such as crystallization. The method is attractive in that it requires miniscule quantities of proteins, it can be performed using intrinsic tryptophan and tyrosine fluorescence, and, with the right equipment, it is easy to perform. To date, the method has been used with proteins in liquid solutions and dispersions. It was of interest to determine if DSF could be used with membrane proteins in the lipid cubic phase (LCP), which increasingly is being used for crystallization in support of structure–function studies. The cubic phase is viscous. Furthermore, in coexistence with excess aqueous solution, as happens during crystallization trials, it can become turbid and scatter light.

This mutation destabilizes the complex and compromises its function in translation regulation, leading to protein misfolding, proteotoxic stress, and eventual neuronal death. In addition, we show that substantial microgliosis is triggered by the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in the cerebellum and that blocking NLRP3 function in vivo significantly delays neuronal degeneration and the onset of ataxia in mutant animals.

abstract = {We designed a bacterio-mimetic nanoparticle that can noncovalently control the orientation of attached antibodies. Liposomes with Fc-binding peptide (FcBP), formulated using FcBPconjugated PEGylated lipid, were used as model nanoparticles. Compared with control nanoparticles surface-modified with antibody covalently attached via maleimide functional groups (Mal-NPs), FcBP-capped nanoparticles (FcBP-NPs) exhibited greater binding affinity to the target protein. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-specific antibodymodified FcBP-NPs (HER2/FcBP-NPs) showed 5.3-fold higher binding affinity to HER2 than isotype IgG antibody-modified NPs, and 2.6-fold higher affinity compared with HER2 antibody-conjugated Mal-NPs. Cellular uptake of HER2/FcBP-NPs in HER2-positive cells was significantly higher than that of other formulations. The biodistribution of HER2/FcBPNPs was higher than that of antibody-conjugated NPs in HER2-positive tumor tissues, but not in HER2-negative tumors. Our findings suggest the potential of bacteriomimetic nanoparticles for controlling the orientation of antibody attachment. These nanoparticles may have diverse applications in nanomedicine, including drug delivery, molecular imaging, and diagnosis.},

abstract = {Introduction of specific point mutations has been an effective strategy in enhancing the thermostability of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Our previous work showed that a specific residue position on transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) in class A GPCRs consistently yields thermostable mutants. The crystal structure of human chemokine receptor CCR5 also showed increased thermostability upon mutation of two positions, A233D6.33 and K303E7.59. With the goal of testing the transferability of these two thermostabilizing mutations in other chemokine receptors, we tested the mutations A237D6.33 and R307E7.59 in human CCR3 for thermostability and aggregation properties in detergent solution. Interestingly, the double mutant exhibited a 6–10-fold decrease in the aggregation propensity of the wild-type protein. This is in stark contrast to the two single mutants whose aggregation properties resemble the wild type (WT). Moreover, unlike in CCR5, the two single mutants separately showed no increase in thermostability c...},

Our combined approach allowed for visualization of the small subunit as it assembled and revealed that with the exception of key helices in the platform domain, all other 16S rRNA domains fold even in the absence of Era. Notably, the maturing particles did not stall while waiting for the platform domain to mature and instead re-routed their folding pathway to enable concerted maturation of other structural motifs spanning multiple rRNA domains. We also found that binding of Era to the mature 30S subunit destabilized helix 44 and the decoding center preventing binding of YjeQ, another assembly factor.

abstract = {The entry of human immunodeficiency virus into host cells is mediated by the envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimeric spike, which consists of three exterior gp120 subunits and three transmembrane gp41 subunits. The trimeric Env undergoes extensive conformational rearrangement upon interaction with the CD4 receptor, transitioning from the unliganded, “closed” State 1 to more-open downstream State 2 and State 3 conformations. Changes in “restraining” amino acid residues, such as leucine 193 and isoleucine 423, destabilize State 1 Env, which then assumes entry-competent, downstream conformations. The introduction of an artificial disulfide bond linking the gp120 and gp41 subunits (SOS) in combination with the I559P (IP) change has allowed structural characterization of soluble gp140 (sgp140) trimers. The conformation of these SOSIP-stabilized sgp140 trimers has been suggested to represent the closed native State 1 conformation. Here we compare the impact on the membrane Env conformation of the SOSIP changes with that of the well-characterized changes (L193R and I423A) that shift Env to downstream States 2 and 3. The results presented here suggest that the SOSIP changes stabilize Env in a conformation that differs from State 1 but also from the downstream Env conformations stabilized by L193R or I423A. IMPORTANCE The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer is triggered by receptor binding to mediate the entry of the virus into cells. Most structural studies of Env trimers have utilized truncated soluble gp140 Envs stabilized with the I559P and SOS changes. Here we present evidence indicating that these stabilizing changes have a profound impact on the conformation of Env, moving Env away from the native pretriggered Env conformation. Our studies underscore the need to acquire structural information on the pretriggered Env conformation, which is recognized by most broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies.},

The DEAD-box RNA helicase protein DDX21 has been shown to bind and remodel RNA quadruplexes but little is known about its specificity for different quadruplex species. Previous reports have suggested DDX21 may interact with telomeric repeat containing RNA quadruplex (TERRA), an integral component of the telomere that contributes to telomeric heterochromatin formation and telomere length regulation. Here we report that the C-terminus of DDX21 directly interacts with TERRA. We use, for the first time, 2D saturation transfer difference NMR to map the protein binding site on a ribonucleic acid species and show that the quadruplex binding domain of DDX21 interacts primarily with the phosphoribose backbone of quadruplexes. Furthermore, by mutating the 2′OH of loop nucleotides we can drastically reduce DDX21's affinity for quadruplex, indicating that the recognition of quadruplex and specificity for TERRA is mediated by interactions with the 2′OH of loop nucleotides.},

Responsible for the long half-life is FcRn that protects albumin from intracellular degradation. An in-depth understanding of how FcRn binds albumin across species is of importance for design and evaluation of albumin-based therapeutics. Albumin consists of three homologous domains where domain I and domain III of human albumin are crucial for binding to human FcRn. Here, we show that swapping of two loops in domain I or the whole domain with the corresponding sequence in mouse albumin results in reduced binding to human FcRn. In contrast, humanizing domain I of mouse albumin improves binding. We reveal that domain I of mouse albumin plays a minor role in the interaction with the mouse and human receptors, as domain III on its own binds with similar affinity as full-length mouse albumin. Further, we show that P573 in domain III of mouse albumin is required for strong receptor binding. Our study highlights distinct differences in structural requirements for the interactions between mouse and human albumin with their respective receptor, which should be taken into consideration in design of albumin-based drugs and evaluation in mouse models.},

Here, we determined the structures of a eukaryotic Nav channel alone and in complex with a lethal $\alpha$-scorpion toxin, AaH2, by electron microscopy, both at 3.5-A resolution. AaH2 wedges into voltage-sensor domain IV (VSD4) to impede fast activation by trapping a deactivated state in which gating charge interactions bridge to the acidic intracellular C-terminal domain. In the absence of AaH2, the S4 helix of VSD4 undergoes a $\sim$13-{\AA} translation to unlatch the intracellular fast inactivation gating machinery. Highlighting the polypharmacology of $\alpha$-scorpion toxins, AaH2 also targets an unanticipated receptor site on VSD1 and a pore-glycan adjacent to VSD4.

By contrast, a chronic lymphocytic leukemia-derived BCR forms dimers and oligomers in the absence of a stimulus, but a single amino acid exchange reverts its organization to monomers in unstimulated B cells. Our super-resolution microscopy approach for quantitatively analyzing cell surface proteins may thus help reveal the nanoscale organization of immunoreceptors in various cell types.},

Here, we chart the discovery of a phenanthridinone based compound (Lig9) from the NCI Diversity Set III by rational methods by in silico screening and crystallographic validation. The crystal structure of the complex with SOD1, refined to 2.5 {\AA}, revealed that Lig9 binds the SOD1 b-barrel in the b-strand 2 and 3 region which is known to scaffold SOD1 fibrillation. The phenanthridinone moiety makes a substantial p–p interaction with Trp32 of SOD1. The compound possesses a significant binding affinity for SOD1 and inhibits oxidation of Trp32; a critical residue for SOD1 aggregation. Thus, Lig9 is a good candidate from which to develop a new library of SOD1 aggregation inhibitors through protection of Trp32 oxidation.},

Although much is known about how scaffolds colocalize signaling proteins, it is unclear whether scaffolds promote signal amplification. Here, we used arrestin-3, a scaffold of the ASK1- MKK4/7-JNK3 cascade, as a model to understand signal amplification by a scaffold protein. We found that arrestin-3 exhibited >15-fold higher affinity for inactive JNK3 than for active JNK3, and this change involved a shift in the binding site following JNK3 activation. We used systems biochemistry modeling and Bayesian inference to evaluate how the activation of upstream kinases contributed to JNK3 phosphorylation. Our combined experimental and computational approach suggested that the catalytic phosphorylation rate of JNK3 at Thr-221 by MKK7 is two orders of magnitude faster than the corresponding phosphorylation of Tyr-223 by MKK4 with or without arrestin-3. Finally, we showed that the release of activated JNK3 was critical for signal amplification. Collectively, our data suggest a “conveyor belt” mechanism for signal amplification by scaffold proteins. This mechanism informs on a long-standing mystery for how few upstream kinase molecules activate numerous downstream kinases to amplify signaling.},

Changes in temperature affect the capacity of H-NS to form multimers that condense DNA and restrict gene expression. However, the molecular mechanism through which H-NS senses temperature and other physiochemical parameters remains unclear and controversial. Combining structural, biophysical and computational analyses, we show that human body temperature promotes unfolding of the central dimerization domain, breaking up H-NS multimers. This unfolding event enables an autoinhibitory compact H-NS conformation that blocks DNA binding. Our integrative approach provides the molecular basis for H-NS– mediated environment-sensing and may open new avenues for the control of pathogenic multi-drug resistant bacteria.},

abstract = {Males of the parasitic wasp genus Nasonia use blends of chiral hydroxylactones as sex pheromones to attract conspecific females. Whereas all Nasonia species use a mixture of (4R,5S)-5-hydroxy-4- decanolide (RS) and 4-methylquinazoline (MQ) as sex pheromones, Nasonia vitripennis evolved (4R,5R)-5-hydroxy-4-decanolide (RR) as an extra sex pheromone component. We recently identified and functionally characterized three short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) NV10127, NV10128, and NV10129 that are capable of catalyzing the epimerization of RS to RR via (4R)-5-oxo-4-decanolide (ODL) as intermediate. Despite their very high sequence identities of 88–98%, these proteins differ drastically in their ability to epimerize RS to RR and in their stereoselectivity when reducing ODL to RR/ RS. Here, in order to unravel the sequence differences underlying these varying functional properties of NV1027, NV10128 and NV10129, we created chimeras of the three enzymes and monitored their catalytic activities in vitro. The results show that a few amino acid changes at the C-termini and active sites of Nasonia vitripennis SDRs lead to substantially altered RS to RR epimerization and ODLreduction activities. Thus, our study adds to the understanding of pheromone evolution by showing that subtle mutations in key biosynthetic enzymes can result in drastic effects on the composition of chemical signals.},

abstract = {The incorporation of diamondoid amino acids (DAAs) into peptide-like drugs is a general strategy to improve lipophilicity, membrane permeability, and metabolic stability of peptidomimetic pharmaceuticals. We designed and synthesized five novel peptidic DAA-containing kinase inhibitors of protein kinase A using a sophisticated molecular dynamics protocol and solid-phase peptide synthesis. By means of a thermophoresis binding assay, NMR, and crystal structure analysis, we determined the influence of the DAAs on the secondary structure and binding affinity in comparison to the native protein kinase inhibitor, which is purely composed of proteinogenic amino acids. Affinity and binding pose are largely conserved. One variant showed 6.5-fold potency improvement, most likely related to its increased side chain lipophilicity. A second variant exhibited slightly decreased affinity presumably due to loss of hydrogen-bond contacts to surrounding water molecules of the first solvation shell.},

abstract = {The rules of the genetic code are established by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) enzymes, which covalently link tRNA with the cognate amino acid. Many aaRSs are involved in diverse cellular processes beyond translation, acting alone, or in complex with other proteins. However, studies of aaRS noncanonical assembly and functions in plants are scarce, as are structural studies of plant aaRSs. Here, we have solved the crystal structure of Arabidopsis thaliana cytosolic seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS), which is the first crystallographic structure of a plant aaRS. Arabidopsis SerRS displays structural features typical of canonical SerRSs, except for a unique intrasubunit disulfide bridge. In a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified BEN1, a protein involved in the metabolism of plant brassinosteroid hormones, as a protein interactor of Arabidopsis SerRS. The SerRS:BEN1 complex is one of the first protein complexes of plant aaRSs discovered so far, and is a rare example of an aaRS interacting with an enzyme involved in primary or secondary metabolism. To pinpoint regions responsible for this interaction, we created truncated variants of SerRS and BEN1, and identified that the interaction interface involves the SerRS globular catalytic domain and the N-terminal extension of BEN1 protein. BEN1 does not have a strong impact on SerRS aminoacylation activity, indicating that the primary function of the complex is not the modification of SerRS canonical activity. Perhaps SerRS performs as yet unknown noncanonical functions mediated by BEN1. These findings indicate that – via SerRS and BEN1 – a link exists between the protein translation and steroid metabolic pathways of the plant cell.},

abstract = {One of the central challenges in the development of single-molecule protein sequencing technologies is achieving high-fidelity sequential recognition and detection of specific amino acids that comprise the peptide sequence. An approach towards achieving this goal is to leverage naturally occurring proteins that function through recognition of amino (N)-terminal amino acids (NAAs). One such protein, the N-end rule pathway adaptor protein ClpS, natively recognizes NAAs on a peptide chain. The native ClpS protein has a high specificity albeit modest affinity for the amino acid Phe at the N-terminus but also recognizes the residues Trp, Tyr, and Leu at the N-terminal position. Here, we employed directed evolution methods to select for ClpS variants with enhanced affinity and selectivity for two NAAs (Phe and Trp). Using this approach, we identified two promising variants of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens ClpS protein with native residues 34–36 ProArgGlu mutated to ProMetSer and CysProSer. In vitro surface binding assays indicate that the ProMetSer variant has enhanced affinity for Phe at the N-terminus with sevenfold tighter binding relative to wild-type ClpS, and that the CysProSer variant binds selectively to Trp over Phe at the N-terminus while having a greater affinity for both Trp and Phe. Taken together, this work demonstrates the utility of engineering ClpS to make it more effective for potential use in peptide sequencing applications.},

However, there is no efficient method for the real-time detection of GTs and the rapid isolation of the target fungi strains with the high expression of GTs. In the present work, we firstly developed a two-photon ratiometric fluorescent probe N-(n-butyl)-4-hydroxy-1,8-naphthalimide (NHN) for detecting the glucosyltransferases activity and intracellular imaging of GTs. Under the UV light (365 nm), the transformed product of NHN mediated by intracellular glucosyltransferase displayed blue emission to guide the rapid isolation of fungal strains possessing overexpression of GTs from the complex soil samples. Finally, by using the fluorescent probe, two target fungi were isolated and identified to be Rhizopus oryzae and Mucor circinelloides by molecular analysis, and they exhibited a robust capability to regioand stereospecific O-glycosylation. Our results fully demonstrated that NHN may be a promising tool for guiding real-time GTs activity in fungal strains, and even for developing natural fungal strains with GTs overexpression.},

abstract = {Citrullination is an essential post-translational modification in which the guanidinium group of protein and peptide arginines is deiminated by peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs). When deregulated, excessive citrullination leads to inflammation as in severe periodontal disease (PD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Porphyromonas gingivalis is the major periodontopathogenic causative agent of PD and also an etiological agent of RA. It secretes a PAD, termed Porphyromonas PAD (PPAD), which is a virulence factor that causes aberrant citrullination. Analysis of P. gingivalis genomes of laboratory strains and clinical isolates unveiled a PPAD variant (PPAD-T2), which showed three amino-acid substitutions directly preceding catalytic Residue H236 (G231 N/E232 T/N235 D) when compared with PPAD from the reference strain (PPAD-T1). Mutation of these positions in the reference strain resulted in twofold higher cell-associated citrullinating activity. Similar to PPAD-T1, recombinant PPAD-T2 citrullinated arginines at the C-termini of general peptidic substrates but not within peptides. Catalytically, PPAD-T2 showed weaker substrate binding but higher turnover rates than PPAD-T1. In contrast, no differences were found in thermal stability. The 1.6 {\AA}-resolution X-ray crystal structure of PPAD-T2 in complex with the general human PAD inhibitor, Cl-amidine, revealed that the inhibitor moiety is tightly bound and that mutations localize to a loop engaged in substrate/inhibitor binding. In particular, mutation G231 N caused a slight structural rearrangement, which probably originated the higher substrate turnover observed. The present data compare two natural PPAD variants and will set the pace for the design of specific inhibitors against P. gingivalis-caused PD.},

We used computational design methods to predict and optimize a total of 53 cyclic and linear peptides targeting myeloid differentiation 2 (MD2) and cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14), both coreceptors of human TLR4. Activity of the designed peptides was first assessed using NF-kB reporter cell lines expressing either TLR4/MD2 or TLR4/CD14 receptors, then binding to CD14 and MD2 confirmed and quantified using MicroScale Thermophoresis. Finally, we incubated select peptides in human whole blood and observed their ability to induce cytokine production, either alone or in synergy with LPS. Our data demonstrate the advantage of computational design for the discovery of new TLR4 peptide activators with little structural resemblance to known ligands and indicate an efficient strategy with which to identify TLR4 targeting peptides that could be used as easy-to-produce alternatives to LPS-derived molecules in a variety of settings.},

Structures of bacterial homologues have provided valuable information on the binding and transport of their natural substrates, but many do not transport medically relevant drugs. In contrast, a homologue from Escherichia coli, DtpA (dipeptide and tripeptide permease), shows a high similarity to human PepT1 (SLC15A1) in terms of ligand selectivity and transports a similar set of drugs. Here, we present the crystal structure of DtpA in ligand-free form (at 3.30 {\AA} resolution) and in complex with the antiviral prodrug valganciclovir (at 2.65 {\AA} resolution) supported by biochemical data. We show that valganciclovir unexpectedly binds with the ganciclovir moiety mimicking the N-terminal residue of a canonical peptide substrate. On the basis of a homology model we argue that this binding mode also applies to the human PepT1 transporter. Our results provide new insights into the binding mode of prodrugs and will assist the rational design of drugs with improved absorption rates. ■},

Here, we describe the structural mechanism for selective recognition of Nt-R by the ZZ domain of p62 (p62ZZ). We show that binding of p62ZZ to Nt-R substrates stimulates p62 aggregation and macroautophagy and is required for autophagic targeting of p62. p62 is essential for mTORC1 activation in response to arginine, but it is not a direct sensor of free arginine in the mTORC1 pathway. We identified a regulatory linker (RL) region in p62 that binds p62ZZ in vitro and may modulate p62 function. Our findings shed new light on the mechanistic and functional significance of the major cytosolic adaptor protein p62 in two fundamental signaling pathways.},

In some bacteria, such as Streptococcus pyogenes, the pathogenicity is strongly linked to the attachment of virulence factors. Their attachment to the cellular membrane is a transpeptidation reaction, catalyzed by sortase enzymes. As such, sortases pose an interesting target for the development of new antivirulence strategies that could yield novel antimicrobial drugs. Using the substitution-oriented fragment screening (SOS) approach, we discovered a potent and specific inhibitor (C10) of sortase A from S. pyogenes. The inhibitor C10 showed high specificity towards S. pyogenes sortase A, with an IC50 value of 10 $\mu$M and a Kd of 60 $\mu$M. We envision that this inhibitor could be employed as a starting point for further exploration of sortase's potential as therapeutic target for antimicrobial drug development.},

The extracellular domain (ECD) of TNFR has been successfully used to clinically treat such TNF-associated diseases. However, large-scale production of these biological material via eukaryotic cell expression systems is usually costly owing to the culture medium and complicated growth conditions. This study aimed to extract pure soluble human TNFR1-ECD and investigate its biological activity, using a prokaryotic expression system. Recombinant vector pMCSG7-TNFR1-ECD was constructed via ligation-independent cloning. The His-tag fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and localized in inclusion bodies. Recombinant TNFR1-ECD was refolded and purified via nickel-affinity chromatography, tag cleavage, followed by cation-exchange chromatography or size-exclusion chromatography. A purity of over 95% and a yield of 9.3 mg protein per liter of bacterial culture media was obtained. The purified protein showed significant affinity of 2.15 nM towards human TNF-$\alpha$ and inhibited TNF-$\alpha$-mediated cytotoxicity in L929 cells, with an ED50 of 0.10 $\mu$g/ml. It formed a self-associated oligomer with a KD of 1.15 $\mu$M, detected via microscale thermophoresis. We thus established a highly efficient approach to construct, express, and purify the recombinant protein of human TNFR1-ECD from a prokaryotic system. The antagonistic bioactivities in vitro indicate this protein as a prospective molecules for drug research against autoimmune diseases characterized by TNF-$\alpha$ overexpression.},

We used (a) a synthetic thermostable CGTase mainly forming a- and b-CD (CD6 and CD7) derived from Geobacillus stearothermophilus ET1/NO2 (GeoT), and (b) a CGTase with lower cyclization activity from the alkaliphilic Bacillus sp.

A comparison of the optimum temperature and pH, thermal stability, and CD products synthesized by the variants revealed that the B domain had a major impact on the cyclization activity, thermal stability, and product specificity of the constructed chimera. Complete suppression of the synthesis of CD6 was observed with the variants GeoT-A1/B and GeoT-A1/A2/CDE. The variant GeoT-A1/A2/CDE showed the desired enzyme properties for large-ring CD synthesis. Its melting temperature was 9 °C higher compared to the G825-6 CGTase and it synthesized up to 3.3 gL 1 CD9 to CD12, corresponding to a 1.8- and 2.3-fold increase compared to GeoT and G825-6 CGTase, respectively.

The fidelity of this phosphotransfer reaction from the SK to the RR provides specificity to TCS signaling. In the present study, we show that for TcrX, a transcriptionally autoregulated RR of M. tuberculosis, acetylation enhances its net phosphorylation from cognate SK TcrY and lowers it from a non-cognate SK MtrB. Similar acetylation mediated increase in phosphorylation was also observed for another RR MtrA from cognate SK MtrB. Thus, we establish a novel TCS signaling design wherein acetylation of RRs results in enhanced cognate phosphorylation and suppresses non-cognate phosphorylation. Using wild type or acetylation-deficient TcrX proteins in M. tuberculosis H37Ra, we demonstrate that non-acetylated TcrX acts as a ‘phosphate sink' for MtrB and suppressing signal propagation from MtrB to MtrA in vivo, linking metabolism to TCS signaling. Overall, we report that acetylation of RRs shields TCSs from crosstalk, modulates the phosphatase activities and alters the DNAbinding activities of RRs, all of which are non-intuitive behavior of TCS systems.},

abstract = {Studies to identify novel immune-regulatory functions of active vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) in human CD4+ T cells revealed that 1,25(OH)2D3 potently induced expression of the gene SERPINA1, encoding the anti-protease $\alpha$-1- antitrypsin. We confirmed $\alpha$-1-antitrypsin protein expression by 1,25(OH)2D3-treated CD4+ T cells, but not in CD8+ T cells or monocytes. $\alpha$-1-Antitrypsin promotes anti-inflammatory IL-10 synthesis in other immune cell populations. We therefore investigated its immune-regulatory effects in CD4+ T cells. Plasma-derived $\alpha$-1-antitrypsin drove IL-10 synthesis by CD4+ T cells, which was not dependent on anti-protease activity, but appeared to require a serum-binding factor, since this could not be achieved with recombinant protein. $\alpha$-1-Antitrypsin is reported to bind complement components, which regulate T cell function. A role for this interaction was therefore probed. Plasma-derived, but not recombinant $\alpha$-1-antitrypsin contained C3a. Surface Plasmon Resonance and Microscale Thermophoresis demonstrated $\alpha$-1-antitrypsin binding to C3a. Addition of C3a to CD4+ T cells cultured with recombinant $\alpha$-1-antitrypsin restored induction of IL-10, whereas neutralisation of C3a abrogated IL-10 induced by plasma-derived $\alpha$-1-antitrypsin. To interrogate an endogenous role for the $\alpha$-1- antitrypsin-C3a axis in 1,25(OH)2D3-driven CD4+ T cell IL-10 synthesis, we treated cells from healthy or $\alpha$-1- antitrypsin-deficient individuals (which transcribe SERPINA1 but do not secrete protein) with 1,25(OH)2D3. A significant correlation was identified between SERPINA1 and IL10 gene expression in healthy donor CD4+ T cells, which was absent in cells from $\alpha$-1-antitrypsin-deficient individuals. Therefore, $\alpha$-1-antitrypsin is required for 1,25(OH)2D3-induced IL-10 expression in CD4+ T cells, interacting with C3a to drive IL-10 expression.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making the development of effectiveTB vaccines a global priority. A TB vaccine consisting of a recombinant fusion protein, H4, combined witha novel synthetic cationic adjuvant, IC31{\textregistered}, is currently being developed. The H4 fusion protein consistsof two immunogenic mycobacterial antigens, Ag85 B and TB10.4, and the IC31{\textregistered}adjuvant is a mixture ofKLK, a leucine-rich peptide (KLKL5KLK), and the oligodeoxynucleotide ODN1a, a TLR9 ligand. However,efficient and robust methods for assessing these formulated components are lacking. Here, we developedand optimized phase analysis light scattering (PALS), electrical sensing zone (ESZ), and Raman, FTIR, andCD spectroscopy methods to characterize the H4-IC31 vaccine formulation. PALS-measured conductiv-ity and zeta potential values could differentiate between the similarly sized particles of IC31{\textregistered}adjuvantand the H4-IC31 vaccine candidate and could thereby serve as a control during vaccine formulation. Inaddition, zeta potential is indicative of the adjuvant to antigen ratio which is the key in the immunomod-ulatory response of the vaccine. ESZ was used as an orthogonal method to measure IC31{\textregistered}and H4-IC31particle sizes. Raman, FTIR, and CD spectroscopy revealed structural changes in H4 protein and IC31{\textregistered}adjuvant, inducing an increase in both the -sheet and random coil content as a result of adsorption.Furthermore, nanoDSF showed changes in the tertiary structure of H4 protein as a result of adjuvanta-tion to IC31{\textregistered}. Our findings demonstrate the applicability of biophysical methods to characterize vaccinecomponents in the final H4-IC31 drug product without the requirement for desorption.},

abstract = {Heterokonts, Alveolata protists, green algae from Charophyta and Chlorophyta divisions, and all Embryophyta plants possess an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) gene named ALDH12. Here, we provide a biochemical characterization of two ALDH12 family members from the lower plant Physcomitrella patens and higher plant Zea mays. We show that ALDH12 encodes an NAD+-dependent glutamate $\gamma$-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (GSALDH), which irreversibly converts glutamate $\gamma$-semialdehyde (GSAL), a mitochondrial intermediate of the proline and arginine catabolism, to glutamate. Sedimentation equilibrium and small-angle X-ray scattering analyses reveal that in solution both plantGSALDHsexist as equilibrium between a domain-swapped dimer and the dimer-ofdimers tetramer. Plant GSALDHs share very low-sequence identity with bacterial, fungal, and animal GSALDHs (classified as ALDH4), which are the closest related ALDH superfamily members. Nevertheless, the crystal structure of ZmALDH12 at 2.2-{\AA} resolution shows that nearly all key residues involved in the recognition of GSAL are identical to those in ALDH4, indicating a close functional relationship with ALDH4. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the transition from ALDH4 to ALDH12 occurred during the evolution of the endosymbiotic plant ancestor, prior to the evolution of green algae and land plants. Finally, ALDH12 expression in maize and moss is downregulated in response to salt and drought stresses, possibly to maintain proline levels. Taken together, these results provide molecular insight into the biological roles of the plant ALDH12 family.},

abstract = {TheMycobacteriumtuberculosis (Mtb) Rv2747 gene encodes for a functional protein known as ArgA,which plays an important role in the first step of the L-arginine biosynthesis pathway. ArgA transfers the acetyl group fromthe acetyl-CoA to either L-glutamate or L-glutamine, which are the known substrates. Here, we present two crystal structures of ArgA: one complexed with CoA and product bound N-acetylglutamine and the other complexed with acetyl-CoA and the inhibitor L-arginine at 2.3 and 3.0 {\AA} resolution respectively. The Mtb ArgA protomer was found to have a “V” cleft and a “$\beta$” bulge, archetypal of a classical GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase superfamily of proteins. The product bound form implies that ArgA can also acetylate L-glutamine like L-glutamate. The active site is strongly inhibited by L-arginine resulting in a closed conformation of ArgA and both Larginine and N-acetylglutamine were found to occupy at the same active site. Together with structural analysis, molecular docking studies, microscale thermophoresis and enzyme inhibition assays, we conclude that L-glutamine, L-glutamate and L-arginine, all occupy at the same active site of ArgA. Furthermore in case of Mtb ArgA, L-arginine does not act as an allosteric inhibitor unlike other N-acetylglutamate synthase family of proteins.},

abstract = {Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major complication in long‐standing diabetic patients, and effective therapies are required. In this study, we examined the effects and mechanisms of an arabinoglucan (AG) isolated from Angelica sinensis on DN, which was induced in rats by streptozotocin. The rats were intraperitoneally treated with AG for 8 weeks. Diabetic rats exhibited renal dysfunction, as evidenced by reduced creatinine clearance, increased blood urea nitrogen and proteinuria, along with marked enhanced mesangial expansion. All of these abnormalities were reversed by the AG. Overproliferation of glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) was halted by AG treatment, and inflammation mediators were attenuated. Furthermore, the AG significantly inhibited the expression of nuclear factor‐$\kappa$B (NF‐$\kappa$B) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), both in diabetic kidneys and in high glucose‐induced GMCs. Using an NF‐$\kappa$B inhibitor, RAGE siRNA and RAGE‐overexpressing plasmid, we further demonstrated that the AG inhibited GMC viability mediated by RAGE/NF‐$\kappa$B signaling pathway. More importantly, we show that the AG can directly interact with RAGE and disrupt RAGE binding to advanced glycation end products using microscale thermophoresis. These findings suggest that this AG, acting as a RAGE antagonist, is a promising agent for the prevention and treatment of DN.},

abstract = {Enzymes are attractive tools for synthetic applications. To be viable for industrial use enzymes need sufficient stability towards the desired reaction conditions such as high substrate and cosolvent concentration, non-neutral pH and elevated temperatures. Thermal stability is an attractive feature not only because it allows for protein purification by thermal treatment and higher process temperatures, but also due to the associated higher stability against other destabilising factors. Therefore, highthroughput screening methods are desirable for the identification of thermostable biocatalysts by discovery from nature or by protein engineering but current methods have low throughput and require time-demanding purification of protein samples. We found that nanoscale differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) is a valuable tool to rapidly and reliably determine melting points of native proteins. To avoid intrinsic problems posed by crude protein extracts, hypotonic extraction of overexpressed protein from bacterial host cells resulted in higher sample quality and accurate manual determination of several hundred melting temperatures per day. We have probed the use of nanoDSF for high-throughput screening of a phylogenetically diverse aldolase library to identify novel thermostable enzymes from metagenomic sources and for the rapid measurements of variants from saturation mutagenesis. The feasibility of nanoDSF for the screening of synthetic reaction conditions was proved by studies of co-solvent tolerance, which showed protein melting temperature to decrease linearly with increasing cosolvent concentration for all combinations of six enzymes and eight watermiscible cosolvents investigated, and of substrate affinity, which showed stabilization of hexokinase by sugars in the absence of ATP cofactor.},

abstract = {The Na+/H+ exchanger NHE1 is critical for cell vitality as it controls intracellular pH and cell volume. Its functionality is influenced by calcineurin B homologous proteins (CHPs). The human isoform CHP3 is important for transport of NHE1 to the plasma membrane and for its activity. Here, we characterized the binding interaction of human CHP3 with the regulatory domain of NHE1. The exact binding site of CHP3 was previously debated. CHP3 as well as both regions of NHE1 in question were produced and purified. CHP3 specifically formed stable complexes with the CHP-binding region (CBD) of NHE1 (residues 503–545) in size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), but not with the C-terminal region (CTD, residues 633–815). CTD was functional as shown by Ca2+-dependent binding of calmodulin in SEC analysis. CHP3 bound with high affinity to CBD with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 56 nM determined by microscale thermophoresis. The high affinity was substantiated by isothermal calorimetry analysis (KD = 3 nM), which also revealed that the interaction with CBD is strongly exothermic ($\Delta$G° = −48.6 kJ/mol, $\Delta$H = −75.3 kJ/mol, −T$\Delta$S° = 26.7 kJ/mol). The data provide insights in the molecular mechanisms that underlie the regulatory interaction of CHP3 and NHE1 and more general of calcineurin homologous proteins with their target proteins.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been dramatic growth in the study of RNA. RNA has gone from being known as an intermediate in the central dogma of molecular biology to a molecule with a large diversity of structure and function that is involved in all aspects of biology. As new functions are rapidly discovered, it has become clear that there is a need for RNA-targeting small molecule probes to investigate RNA biology and clarify the potential for therapeutics based on RNA–small molecule interactions. While a host of techniques exist to measure RNA–small molecule interactions, many of these have drawbacks that make them intractable for routine use and are often not broadly applicable. A newer technology called microscale thermophoresis (MST), which measures the directed migration of a molecule and/or molecule–ligand complex along a temperature gradient, can be used to measure binding affinities using very small amounts of sample. The high sensitivity of this technique enables measurement of affinity constants in the nanomolar and micromolar range. Here, we demonstrate how MST can be used to study a range of biologically relevant RNA interactions, including peptide–RNA interactions, RNA–small molecule interactions, and displacement of an RNA-bound peptide by a small molecule.},

abstract = {We describe for the first time a method that utilizes microscale thermophoresis (MST) technology to determine polyclonal antibody affinities to small molecules. Using a novel type of heterologous MST, we have accurately measured a solution-based binding affinity of serum antibodies to heroin which was previously impossible with other currently available methods. Moreover, this mismatch approach (i.e., using a cross-reactive hapten tracer) has never been reported in the literature. When compared with equilibrium dialysis combined with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (ED-UPLC/MS/MS), this novel MST method yields similar binding affinity values for polyclonal antibodies to the major heroin metabolites 6-AM and morphine. Additionally, we herein report the method of synthesis of this novel cross-reactive hapten, MorHap-acetamide—a useful analog for the study of heroin hapten–antibody interactions. Using heterologous MST, we were able to determine the affinities, down to nanomolar accuracies, of polyclonal antibodies to various abused opioids. While optimizing this method, we further discovered that heroin is protected from serum esterase degradation by the presence of these antibodies in a concentration-dependent manner. Lastly, using affinity data for a number of structurally different opioids, we were able to dissect the moieties that are crucial to antibody binding. The novel MST method that is presented herein can be extended to the analysis of any ligand that is prone to degradation and can be applied not only to the development of vaccines to substances of abuse but also to the analysis of small molecule/protein interactions in the presence of serum.

abstract = {Nanobodies represent the variable binding domain of camelid heavy-chain antibodies and are employed in a rapidly growing range of applications in biotechnology and biomedicine. Their success is based on unique properties including their reported ability to reversibly refold after heat-induced denaturation. This view, however, is contrasted by studies which involve irreversibly aggregating nanobodies, asking for a quantitative analysis that clearly defines nanobody thermoresistance and reveals the determinants of unfolding reversibility and aggregation propensity. By characterizing nearly 70 nanobodies, we show that irreversible aggregation does occur upon heat denaturation for the large majority of binders, potentially affecting application-relevant parameters like stability and immunogenicity. However, by deriving aggregation propensities from apparent melting temperatures, we show that an optional disulfide bond suppresses nanobody aggregation. This effect is further enhanced by increasing the length of a complementarity determining loop which, although expected to destabilize, contributes to nanobody stability. The effect of such variations depends on environmental conditions, however. Nanobodies with two disulfide bonds, for example, are prone to lose their functionality in the cytosol. Our study suggests strategies to engineer nanobodies that exhibit optimal performance parameters and gives insights into general mechanisms which evolved to prevent protein aggregation.},

abstract = {The NADPH oxidase enzyme complex, NOX2, is responsible for reactive oxygen species production in neutrophils and has been recognized as a key mediator of inflammation. Here, we have performed rational design and in silico screen to identify a small molecule inhibitor, Phox-I1, targeting the interactive site of p67phoxwith Rac GTPase, which is a necessary step of the signaling leading to NOX2 activation. Phox-I1 binds to p67phoxwith a submicromolar affinity and abrogates Rac1 binding and is effective in inhibiting NOX2-mediated superoxide production dose-dependently in human and murine neutrophils without detectable toxicity. Medicinal chemistry characterizations have yielded promising analogs and initial information of the structure-activity relationship of Phox-I1. Our studies suggest the potential utility of Phox-I class inhibitors in NOX2 oxidase inhibition and present an application of rational targeting of a small GTPase-effector interface. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, increase in half-lives of IgG and albumin-based therapeutics has the potential to improve their efficacies, but there is a great need for robust methods for screening of relative FcRn-dependent recycling ability. Here, we report on a novel human endothelial cell-based recycling assay (HERA) that can be used for such pre-clinical screening. In HERA, rescue from degradation depends on FcRn, and engineered ligands are recycled in a manner that correlates with their half-lives in human FcRn transgenic mice. Thus, HERA is a novel cellular assay that can be used to predict how FcRn-binding proteins are rescued from intracellular degradation.},

Activation of the central nuclear decoder, calcium- and calmodulin-dependent kinase (CCaMK), triggers the entire symbiotic program including root nodule organogenesis, but the mechanism of signal transduction by CCaMK was unknown. We show that CYCLOPS, a direct phosphorylation substrate of CCaMK, is a DNA-binding transcriptional activator. Two phosphorylated serine residues within the N-terminal negative regulatory domain of CYCLOPS are necessary for its activity. CYCLOPS binds DNA in a sequence-specific and phosphorylation-dependent manner and transactivates the NODULE INCEPTION (NIN) gene. A phosphomimetic version of CYCLOPS was sufficient to trigger root nodule organogenesis in the absence of rhizobia and CCaMK. CYCLOPS thus induces a transcriptional activation cascade, in which NIN and a heterotrimeric NF-Y complex act in hierarchical succession to initiate symbiotic root nodule development. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

To maximize the likelihood of identifying genuine binders to a molecular target, and avoid wasting resources following up compounds with unproductive/nonspecific mechanisms of action, it is important to employ a range of assays during an HTS campaign that build confidence of target engagement for hit compounds. Biophysical methods that measure direct target/compound engagement have established themselves as key techniques in generating this confidence, and they are now integral to the latter stages of HTS triage at the European Lead Factory (ELF). One relatively new technique that the ELF is using is microscale thermophoresis (MST), which measures the differences in rate of movement through a temperature gradient that are caused when single molecular species form complexes.

We show that SapA has the lowest lipid specificity for SapNP formation. These nanoparticles are modular and offer a tunable range of size and composition depending on the stoichiometric ratio of lipid and saposin components. They are stable and exhibit features typical of lipid-bilayer systems. Our data suggest that SapNPs are versatile and can adapt to membrane proteins of various sizes and architectures. Using SapA and various types of lipids we could reconstitute membrane proteins of different transmembrane cross-sectional areas (from 14 to 56 transmembrane $\alpha$ helices). SapNP-reconstituted proteins bound their respective ligands and were more heat stable compared with the detergent-solubilized form. Moreover, SapNPs encircle membrane proteins in a compact way, allowing structural investigations of small membrane proteins in a detergent-free environment using small-angle X-ray scattering. Saposin-derived lipid nanoparticles (SapNPs) are an alternative tool for membrane protein (MP) reconstitution. Flayhan et al. characterize these nanoparticles, showing that they are versatile and can adapt to MPs of various sizes and architectures.

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Rehabilitation centers and communities. PARTICIPANTS: Powered wheelchair users (N=116). INTERVENTION: Five 30-minute WSTP training sessions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessments were done at baseline (t1), posttraining (t2), and 3 months posttraining (t3) using the Wheelchair Skills Test Questionnaire (WST-Q version 4.1), Goal Attainment Score (GAS), Satisfaction Questionnaire, injury rate, Wheelchair Use Confidence Scale for Power Wheelchair Users (WheelCon), and Life Space Assessment (LSA). RESULTS: There was no significant t2-t1 difference between the groups for WST-Q capacity scores (P=.600), but the difference for WST-Q performance scores was significant (P=.016) with a relative (t2/t1 x 100%) improvement of the median score for the intervention group of 10.8%. The mean GAS +/- SD for the intervention group after training was 92.8%+/-11.4%, and satisfaction with training was high. The WST-Q gain was not retained at t3. There was no clinically significant difference between the groups in injury rate and no statistically significant differences in WheelCon or LSA scores at t3. CONCLUSIONS: Powered wheelchair users who receive formal wheelchair skills training demonstrate modest, transient posttraining improvements in their WST-Q performance scores, have substantial improvements on individualized goals, and are positive about training.},

SiaT adopts the LeuT-fold and is in an outward-open conformation in complex with the sialic acid N-acetylneuraminic acid and two Na+ ions. One Na+ binds to the conserved Na2 site, while the second Na+ binds to a new position, termed Na3, which is conserved in many SSS family members.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) is a frequently used method for the quantitative characterization of intermolecular interactions with several advantages over other technologies. One of these is its capability to determine equilibrium constants in solution including complex biological matrices such as cell lysates. MST requires one binding partner to be fluorescent, which is typically achieved by labeling target proteins with a suitable fluorophore. Here, we present a near-native, site-specific in situ labeling strategy for MST experiments that enables reliable measurements in cell lysates and that has distinct advantages over routine covalent labeling techniques. To this end, we exploited the high-affinity interaction of tris-NTA with oligohistidine-tags, which are popular for purification, immobilization or detection of recombinant proteins. We used various DYE-tris-NTA conjugates to successfully label His-tagged proteins that were either purified or a component of cell lysate. The RED-tris-NTA was identified as the optimal dye conjugate with a high affinity towards oligohistidine-tags, a high fluorescence signal and an optimal signal-to-noise ratio in MST binding experiments. Owing to its emission in the red region of the spectrum, it also enables reliable measurements in complex biological matrices such as cell lysates allowing a more physiologically realistic assessment and eliminating the need for protein purification.},

The results of this study demonstrate that MST is a powerful 12 and practical methodology to quantify interactions between small molecules and protein 13 fibrillar aggregates, which suggest that it can be applied for the identification and 14 development of PET radioligands and potentially of therapeutic candidates for protein 15 misfolding diseases.},

abstract = {Summary Ras GTPases regulate intracellular signaling involved in cell proliferation. Elevated Ras signaling activity has been associated with human cancers. Ras activation is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), of which SOS1 is a major member that transduces receptor tyrosine kinase signaling to Ras. We have developed a rational approach coupling virtual screening with experimental screening in identifying small-molecule inhibitors targeting the catalytic site of SOS1 and SOS1-regulated Ras activity. A lead inhibitor, NSC-658497, was found to bind to SOS1, competitively suppress SOS1-Ras interaction, and dose-dependently inhibit SOS1 GEF activity. Mutagenesis and structure-activity relationship studies map the NSC-658497 site of action to the SOS1 catalytic site, and define the chemical moieties in the inhibitor essential for the activity. NSC-658497 showed dose-dependent efficacy in inhibiting Ras, downstream signaling activities, and associated cell proliferation. These studies establish a proof of principle for rational design of small-molecule inhibitors targeting Ras GEF enzymatic activity.},

abstract = {The availability of well characterized allosteric modulators is of crucial importance for investigating allosteric regulation of protein function. In a recently identified inactive conformation of CDK2 an open allosteric pocket has been detected and proposed as a site to accommodate allosteric inhibitors. Previous structure-based approaches allowed the identification of a hit compound expected to bind to this pocket. Here, we report the characterization of this compound by X-ray crystallography, which surprisingly provided a chemical structure different from the one previously reported. Therefore, the compound was synthesized and completely characterized. X-ray structures of the synthesized and purchased compounds were superimposable. A reaction mechanism was proposed to explain the formation of the structure indicated by X-ray. Moreover, a stereoselective synthesis was developed to evaluate the biological activity of the pure stereoisomers. Modeling studies were performed to unveil the details of the interaction with CDK2. Then, the activity of the obtained compounds was evaluated with different biological assays. Mutagenesis experiments confirmed binding to the allosteric pocket. Finally, the allosteric ligands were shown to inhibit the growth of A549 and SKOV3 cancer cell lines. Therefore, this paper presents a thorough chemical and biological characterization of the first small-molecule ligands to be used as probes to study the allosteric modulation of CDK2 activity.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The ubiquitylation signal promotes trafficking of endogenous and retroviral transmembrane proteins. The signal is decoded by a large set of ubiquitin (Ub) receptors that tether Ub‐binding domains (UBDs) to the trafficking machinery. We developed a structure‐based procedure to scan the protein data bank for hidden UBDs. The screen retrieved many of the known UBDs. Intriguingly, new potential UBDs were identified, including the ALIX‐V domain. Pull‐down, cross‐linking and E3‐independent ubiquitylation assays biochemically corroborated the in silico findings. Guided by the output model, we designed mutations at the postulated ALIX‐V:Ub interface. Biophysical affinity measurements using microscale‐thermophoresis of wild‐type and mutant proteins revealed some of the interacting residues of the complex. ALIX‐V binds mono‐Ub with a K d of 119 $\mu$M. We show that ALIX‐V oligomerizes with a Hill coefficient of 5.4 and IC50 of 27.6 $\mu$M and that mono‐Ub induces ALIX‐V oligomerization. Moreover, we show that ALIX‐V preferentially binds K63 di‐Ub compared with mono‐Ub and K48 di‐Ub. Finally, an in vivo functionality assay demonstrates the significance of ALIX‐V:Ub interaction in equine infectious anaemia virus budding. These results not only validate the new procedure, but also demonstrate that ALIX‐V directly interacts with Ub in vivo and that this interaction can influence retroviral budding.},

abstract = {Background Trehalases are highly conserved enzymes catalyzing the hydrolysis of trehalose in a wide range of organisms. The activity of yeast neutral trehalase Nth1 is regulated in a 14-3-3- and a calcium-dependent manner. The Bmh proteins (the yeast 14-3-3 isoforms) recognize phosphorylated Nth1 and enhance its enzymatic activity through an unknown mechanism. Methods To investigate the structural basis of interaction between Nth1 and Bmh1, we used hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry, circular dichroism spectroscopy and homology modeling to identify structural changes occurring upon the complex formation. Results Our results show that the Bmh1 protein binding affects structural properties of several regions of phosphorylated Nth1: the N-terminal segment containing phosphorylation sites responsible for Nth1 binding to Bmh, the region containing the calcium binding domain, and segments surrounding the active site of the catalytic trehalase domain. The complex formation between Bmh1 and phosphorylated Nth1, however, is not accompanied by the change in the secondary structure composition but rather the change in the tertiary structure. Conclusions The 14-3-3 protein-dependent activation of Nth1 is based on the structural change of both the calcium binding domain and the catalytic trehalase domain. These changes likely increase the accessibility of the active site, thus resulting in Nth1 activation. General significance The results presented here provide a structural view of the 14-3-3 protein-dependent activation of yeast neutral trehalase Nth1, which might be relevant to understand the process of Nth1 activity regulation as well as the role of the 14-3-3 proteins in the regulation of other enzymes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Lithium, with its high theoretical specific capacity and lowest electrochemical potential, has been recognized as the ultimate negative electrode material for next-generation lithium-based high-energy-density batteries. However, a key challenge that has yet to be overcome is the inferior reversibility of Li plating and stripping, typically thought to be related to the uncontrollable morphology evolution of the Li anode during cycling. Here we show that Li-metal texturing (preferential crystallographic orientation) occurs during electrochemical deposition, which governs the morphological change of the Li anode. X-ray diffraction pole-figure analysis demonstrates that the texture of Li deposits is primarily dependent on the type of additive or cross-over molecule from the cathode side. With adsorbed additives, like LiNO3 and polysulfide, the lithium deposits are strongly textured, with Li (110) planes parallel to the substrate, and thus exhibit uniform, rounded morphology. A growth diagram of lithium deposits is given to connect various texture and morphology scenarios for different battery electrolytes. This understanding of lithium electrocrystallization from the crystallographic point of view provides significant insight for future lithium anode materials design in high-energy-density batteries.},

Here we identify Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (Lpd), a 57 kDa moonlighting protein, as the first P. aeruginosa protein that binds the two human terminal pathway inhibitors vitronectin and clusterin. Both human regulators when bound to the bac- terium inhibited effector function of the terminal complement, blocked C5b-9 deposition and protected the bacterium from complement damage. P. aeruginosa when challenged with complement active human serum depleted from vitronectin was severely damaged and bacterial survival was reduced by over 50%. Similarly, when in human serumclusterin was blocked by a mAb, bacterial survival was reduced by 44%. Thus, demonstrating that Pseu- domonas benefits from attachment of each human regulator and controls complement attack. The Lpd binding site in vitronectin was localized to the C-terminal region, i.e. to resi- dues 354–363. Thus, Lpd of P. aeruginosa is a surface exposedmoonlighting protein that binds two human terminal pathway inhibitors, vitronectin and clusterin and each human inhibitor when attached protected the bacterial pathogen from the action of the terminal complement pathway. Our results showed insights into the important function of Lpd as a complement regulator binding protein that might play an important role in virulence of P. aeruginosa.},

abstract = {The ubiquitous mRNA binding protein human antigen R (HuR) participates in the post-transcriptional regulation of many AU-rich element (ARE)-bearing mRNAs. Previously, by using in vitro kinase assay, we have identified serines (Ser) 158, 221 and 318 as targets of protein kinase C (PKC)-triggered phosphorylation. In this study, we tested whether GFP- or GST-tagged HuR constructs bearing a phosphomimetic Ser (S)-to-Asp (D) substitution at the different PKC target sites, would affect different HuR functions including HuR nucleo-cytoplasmic redistribution and binding to different types of ARE-containing mRNAs. The phosphomimetic GFP-tagged HuR protein bearing a phosphomimetic substitution in the hinge region of HuR (HuR-S221D) showed an increased cytoplasmic abundance when compared to wild-type HuR. Conversely, data from in vitro kinase assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), implicates that phosphorylation at Ser 221 is not relevant for mRNA binding of HuR. Quantification of in vitro binding affinities of GST-tagged wild-type HuR and corresponding HuR proteins bearing a phosphomimetic substitution in either RRM2 (HuR-S158D) or in RRM3 (HuR-S318D) by microscale thermophoresis (MST) indicates a specific binding of wild-type HuR to type I, II or type III-ARE-oligonucleotides in the high nanomolar range. Interestingly, phosphomimetic mutation at position 158 or 318 had a negative influence on HuR binding to type I- and type II-ARE-mRNAs whereas it significantly enhanced HuR affinity to a type III-ARE substrate. Our data suggest that differential phosphorylation of HuR by PKCs at different HuR domains coordinates subcellular HuR distribution and leads to a preferential binding to U-rich bearing target mRNA. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We have shown previously that the AKT2 pathway is essential for cell survival and important in malignant transformation. In this study, we demonstrate elevated kinase levels of AKT2 and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) in 32 of 80 primary breast carcinomas. The majority of the cases with the activation are estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) positive, which prompted us to examine whether AKT2 regulates ERalpha activity. We found that constitutively activated AKT2 or AKT2 activated by epidermal growth factor or insulin-like growth factor-1 promotes the transcriptional activity of ERalpha. This effect occurred in the absence or presence of estrogen. Activated AKT2 phosphorylates ERalpha in vitro and in vivo, but it does not phosphorylate a mutant ERalpha in which ser-167 was replaced by Ala. The PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, abolishes both the phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of ERalpha induced by AKT2. However, AKT2-induced ERalpha activity was not inhibited by tamoxifen but was completely abolished by ICI 164,384, implicating that AKT2-activated ERalpha contributes to tamoxifen resistance. Moreover, we found that ERalpha binds to the p85alpha regulatory subunit of PI3K in the absence or presence of estradiol in epithelial cells and subsequently activates PI3K/AKT2, suggesting ERalpha regulation of PI3K/AKT2 through a nontranscriptional and ligand-independent mechanism. These data indicate that regulation between the ERalpha and PI3K/AKT2 pathway (ERalpha-PI3K/AKT2-ERalpha) may play an important role in pathogenesis of human breast cancer and could contribute to ligand-independent breast cancer cell growth.},

abstract = {Recent advances in genome engineering technologies based on the RNA-guided CRISPR endonuclease Cas9 are enabling systematic manipulation of genome function in a variety of organisms, ranging from bacteria and archaea to humans. Cas9 is guided to specific locations within a genome by a short RNA search string. Since genome editing leads to permanent modifications within a genome, the targeting specificity of Cas9 nucleases is of particular importance, especially for clinical application and gene editing. In this work, we demonstrate the versatility of MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) to determine the binding affinities of various single-guide RNA (sgRNA), duplex of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) constructs with Cas9. The MST assay is superior to classical methods like electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) because it allows effortless Kd determination free in solution. Additionally, MST provides excellent sensitivity while consuming a small amount of non-hazardous fluorescent-labeled oligos or protein. We analyzed several modified RNAs, some of which were labeled with the fluorophore Cy5. Using NanoTemper Technologies Monolith NT.115 Pico instrument, we determined the affinities of Cas9 with RNAs differing in length and chemical modification pattern. All interactions were in the lower picomolar range, the highest measured affinity was 1.0 pM.},

TRPM8 is gated by physiologically relevant cold temperatures and chemical ligands that induce cold sensations, such as the analgesic compound menthol. Characterization of TRPM8 ligand-gated channel activation will lead to a better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that underlie TRPM8 function. Here, the direct binding of menthol to the isolated hTRPM8 sensing domain (transmembrane helices S1-S4) is investigated. These data are compared with two mutant sensing domain proteins, Y745H (S2 helix) and R842H (S4 helix), which have been previously identified in full length TRPM8 to be menthol insensitive. The data presented herein show that menthol specifically binds to the wild type, Y745H, and R842H TRPM8 sensing domain proteins. These results are the first to show that menthol directly binds to the TRPM8 sensing domain and indicates that Y745 and R842 residues, previously identified in functional studies as crucial to menthol sensitivity, do not affect menthol binding but instead alter coupling between the sensing domain and the pore domain.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop a method combining chiral separation and biophysical techniques to evaluate the enantioselective affinity of original sulfonamide derivatives towards their therapeutic target, the human carbonic anhydrase II (hACII). The first step consisted in the preparation of the enantiomers by chromatographic separation. The performances of HPLC and Supercritical Fluid Chromatography (SFC) were studied at the analytical scale by optimization of various experimental conditions using adsorbed polysaccharide chiral stationary phases (amylose AD-H and cellulose OD-H). Since SFC allowed obtaining higher enantioresolutions per time unit, it was selected for the semi-preparative scale and successfully used to isolate each enantiomer with a satisfactory enantiomeric purity (>98%). Secondly, microscale thermophoresis (MST) method and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) used as reference method were developed to measure potential enantioselective affinities of these enantiomers towards the hACII. The optimizations of both methods were performed using a reference compound, i.e. acetazolamide, which affinity for hCAII has previously been demonstrated. For all compounds, KD values obtained using MST and SPR were in good agreement, leading to similar affinity scales despite both approaches totally differ (labeling for MST versus immobilization of the protein for SPR). The equilibrium dissociation constants of our original compounds for the hCAII were in the range 100–1000 nM and an enantioselectivity was observed using the MST and SPR methods for the diarylpyrazole 2. Finally, by comparing the MST and SPR techniques, MST appears especially adapted for further screening of a series of sulfonamide derivatives due to the lower time required to estimate a binding constant while consuming as little hCAII as SPR.},

abstract = {Stimulation of T cells leads to distinct changes of their adhesive and migratory properties. Signal propagation from activated receptors to integrins depends on scaffolding proteins such as the adhesion and degranulation promoting adaptor protein (ADAP)(1). Here we have comprehensively investigated the phosphotyrosine interactome of ADAP in T cells and define known and novel interaction partners of functional relevance. While most phosphosites reside in unstructured regions of the protein, thereby defining classical SH2 domain interaction sites for master regulators of T cell signaling such as SLP76, Fyn-kinase, and NCK, other binding events depend on structural context. Interaction proteomics using different ADAP constructs comprising most of the known phosphotyrosine motifs as well as the structured domains confirm that a distinct set of proteins is attracted by pY571 of ADAP, including the $\zeta$-chain-associated protein kinase of 70 kDa (ZAP70). The interaction of ADAP and ZAP70 is inducible upon stimulation either of the T cell receptor (TCR) or by chemokine. NMR spectroscopy reveals that the N-terminal SH2 domains within a ZAP70-tandem-SH2 construct is the major site of interaction with phosphorylated ADAP-hSH3(N) and microscale thermophoresis (MST) indicates an intermediate binding affinity (Kd = 2.3 $\mu$m). Interestingly, although T cell receptor dependent events such as T cell/antigen presenting cell (APC) conjugate formation and adhesion are not affected by mutation of Y571, migration of T cells along a chemokine gradient is compromised. Thus, although most phospho-sites in ADAP are linked to T cell receptor related functions we have identified a unique phosphotyrosine that is solely required for chemokine induced T cell behavior.},

PEGylation enhances drainage and lymphatic uptake following subcutaneous (SC) administration of proteins and protein-like polymers, but the impact of PEGylation of very large proteins (such as antibodies) on subcutaneous and lymphatic pharmacokinetics is unknown. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the impact of PEGylation on the SC absorption and lymphatic disposition of the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab in rats. PEG-trastuzumab was generated via the conjugation of a single 40 kDa PEG-NHS ester to trastuzumab. PEG-trastuzumab showed a 5-fold reduction in HER2 binding affinity, however the in vitro growth inhibitory effects were preserved as a result of changes in cellular trafficking when compared to native trastuzumab. The lymphatic pharmacokinetics of PEG-trastuzumab was evaluated in thoracic lymph duct cannulated rats after IV and SC administration and compared to the pharmacokinetics of native trastuzumab. The IV pharmacokinetics and lymphatic exposure of PEG-trastuzumab was similar when compared to trastuzumab. After SC administration, initial plasma pharmacokinetics and lymphatic exposure were also similar between PEG-trastuzumab and trastuzumab, but the absolute bioavailability of PEG-trastuzumab was 100% when compared to 86.1% bioavailability for trastuzumab. In contrast to trastuzumab, PEG-trastuzumab showed accelerated plasma clearance beginning approximately 7 days after SC, but not IV, administration, presumably as a result of the generation of anti-PEG IgM. This work suggests that PEGylation does not significantly alter the lymphatic disposition of very large proteins, and further suggests that it is unlikely to benefit therapy with monoclonal antibodies.},

In addition, a MST assay was also developed for the detection of the interaction between a variety of small molecules and tau fibrils. The results of this study demonstrate that MST is a powerful and practical methodology to quantify interactions between small molecules and protein fibrillar aggregates, which suggests that it can be applied for the identification and development of PET radioligands and potentially of therapeutic candidates for protein misfolding diseases.},

abstract = {KEY MESSAGE We identify proteins that associate with the THO core complex, and show that the TEX1 and MOS11 components functionally interact, affecting mRNA export and splicing as well as plant development. TREX (TRanscription-EXport) is a multiprotein complex that plays a central role in the coordination of synthesis, processing and nuclear export of mRNAs. Using targeted proteomics, we identified proteins that associate with the THO core complex of Arabidopsis TREX. In addition to the RNA helicase UAP56 and the mRNA export factors ALY2-4 and MOS11 we detected interactions with the mRNA export complex TREX-2 and multiple spliceosomal components. Plants defective in the THO component TEX1 or in the mRNA export factor MOS11 (orthologue of human CIP29) are mildly affected. However, tex1 mos11 double-mutant plants show marked defects in vegetative and reproductive development. In tex1 plants, the levels of tasiRNAs are reduced, while miR173 levels are decreased in mos11 mutants. In nuclei of mos11 cells increased mRNA accumulation was observed, while no mRNA export defect was detected with tex1 cells. Nevertheless, in tex1 mos11 double-mutants, the mRNA export defect was clearly enhanced relative to mos11. The subnuclear distribution of TEX1 substantially overlaps with that of splicing-related SR proteins and in tex1 plants the ratio of certain alternative splicing events is altered. Our results demonstrate that Arabidopsis TEX1 and MOS11 are involved in distinct steps of the biogenesis of mRNAs and small RNAs, and that they interact regarding some aspects, but act independently in others.},

abstract = {Amyloid fibrils are a hallmark of a range of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. A detailed understanding of the physico-chemical properties of the different aggregated forms of proteins, and of their interactions with other compounds of diagnostic or therapeutic interest, is crucial for devising effective strategies against such diseases. Protein aggregates are situated at the boundary between soluble and insoluble structures, and are challenging to study because classical biophysical techniques, such as scattering, spectroscopic and calorimetric methods, are not well adapted for their study. Here we present a detailed characterization of the thermophoretic behavior of different forms of the protein $\alpha$-synuclein, whose aggregation is associated with Parkinson's disease. Thermophoresis is the directed net diffusional flux of molecules and colloidal particles in a temperature gradient. Because of their low volume requirements and rapidity, analytical methods based on this effect have considerable potential for high throughput screening for drug discovery. In this paper we rationalize and describe in quantitative terms the thermophoretic behavior of monomeric, oligomeric and fibrillar forms of $\alpha$-synuclein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that microscale thermophoresis (MST) is a valuable method for screening for ligands and binding partners of even such highly challenging samples as supramolecular protein aggregates.},

@article{Dabrowski2015,
abstract = {UNLABELLED: The paracellular cleft within epithelia/endothelia is sealed by tight junction (TJ) proteins. Their extracellular loops (ECLs) are assumed to control paracellular permeability and are targets of pathogenes. We demonstrated that claudin-1 is crucial for paracellular tightening. Its ECL1 is essential for the sealing and contains two cysteines conserved throughout all claudins.\n\nAIMS: We prove the hypothesis that this cysteine motif forms a redox-sensitive intramolecular disulfide bridge and, hence, the claudin-1-ECL1 constitutes a functional structure which is associated to ECLs of this and other TJ proteins.\n\nRESULTS: The structure and function of claudin-1-ECL1 was elucidated by investigating sequences of this ECL as synthetic peptides, C1C2, and as recombinant proteins, and exhibited a $\beta$-sheet binding surface flanked by an $\alpha$-helix. These sequences bound to different claudins, their ECL1, and peptides with nanomolar binding constants. C-terminally truncated C1C2 (-4aaC) opened cellular barriers and the perineurium. Recombinant ECL1 formed oligomers, and bound to claudin-1 expressing cells. Oligomerization and claudin association were abolished by reducing agents, indicating intraloop disulfide bridging and redox sensitivity.\n\nINNOVATION: The structural and functional model based on our in vitro and in vivo investigations suggested that claudin-1-ECL1 constitutes a functional and ECL-binding $\beta$-sheet, stabilized by a shielded and redox-sensitive disulfide bond.\n\nCONCLUSION: Since the $\beta$-sheet represents a consensus sequence of claudins and further junctional proteins, a general structural feature is implied. Therefore, our model is of general relevance for the TJ assembly in normal and pathological conditions. C1C2-4aaC is a new drug enhancer that is used to improve pharmacological treatment through tissue barriers.},

abstract = {Ligands used on the surface of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) have a significant impact on physiochemical properties of NPs and their interaction in biological environments. In this study, we report a one-pot aqueous synthesis of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA)-functionalized CdTe/CdS/ZnS quantum dots (Qdots) in the presence of thiol-terminated methoxy polyethylene glycol (mPEG) molecules as a surface coordinating ligand. The resulting mPEG?Qdots were characterized by using ? potential, FTIR, thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, and microscale thermophoresis (MST) studies. We investigated the effect of mPEG molecules and their grafting density on the Qdots photophysical properties, colloidal stability, protein binding affinity, and in vitro cellular toxicity. Moreover, cellular binding features of the resulting Qdots were examined by using three-dimensional (3D) tumor-like spheroids, and the results were discussed in detail. Promisingly, mPEG ligands were found to increase colloidal stability of Qdots, reduce adsorption of proteins to the Qdot surface, and mitigate Qdot-induced side effects to a great extent. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy studies revealed that PEGylated Qdots exhibited distinctive cellular interactions with respect to their mPEG grafting density. As a result, mPEG molecules demonstrated a minimal effect on the ZnS shell deposition and the Qdot fluorescence efficiency at a low mPEG density, whereas they showed pronounced effect on Qdot colloidal stability, protein binding affinity, cytotoxicity, and nonspecific binding at a higher mPEG grafting amount.},

@article{Westermaier2013,
abstract = {Aggregation is a common challenge in the optimization of therapeutic antibody formulations. Since initial self-association of two monomers is typically a reversible process, the aim of this study is to identify different excipients that are able to shift this equilibrium to the monomeric state. The hypothesis is that a specific interaction between excipient and antibody may hinder two monomers from approaching each other, based on previous work in which dexamethasone phosphate showed the ability to partially reverse formed aggregates of the monoclonal IgG1 antibody bevacizumab back into monomers. The current study focuses on the selection of therapeutically inactive compounds with similar properties. Adenosine monophosphate, adenosine triphosphate, sucrose-6-phosphate and guanosine monophosphate were selected in silico through similarity searching and docking. All four compounds were predicted to bind to a protein-protein interaction hotspot on the Fc region of bevacizumab and thereby breaking dimer formation. The predictions were supported in vitro: An interaction between AMP and bevacizumab with a dissociation constant of 9.59+/-0.15mM was observed by microscale thermophoresis. The stability of the antibody at elevated temperature (40 degrees C) in a 51mM phosphate buffer pH 7 was investigated in presence and absence of the excipients. Quantification of the different aggregation species by asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation and size exclusion chromatography demonstrates that all four excipients are able to partially overcome the initial self-association of bevacizumab monomers.},

Receptor crystallisation is achieved following purification using a low affinity “carrier” ligand (theophylline) and crystals are then soaked in solutions containing the desired (higher affinity) compounds. Complete datasets to high resolution can then be collected from single crystals and seven structures are reported here of which three are novel. The method significantly improves structural throughput for ligand screening using stabilised GPCRs, thereby actively driving Structure-Based Drug Discovery (SBDD).},

abstract = {A unique aspect of arrestin-3 is its ability to support both receptor-dependent and receptor-independent signaling. Here, we show that inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) is a non-receptor activator of arrestin-3 and report the structure of IP6-activated arrestin-3 at 2.4-{\AA} resolution. IP6-activated arrestin-3 exhibits an inter-domain twist and a displaced C-tail, hallmarks of active arrestin. IP6 binds to the arrestin phosphate sensor, and is stabilized by trimerization. Analysis of the trimerization surface, which is also the receptor-binding surface, suggests a feature called the finger loop as a key region of the activation sensor. We show that finger loop helicity and flexibility may underlie coupling to hundreds of diverse receptors and also promote arrestin-3 activation by IP6. Importantly, we show that effector-binding sites on arrestins have distinct conformations in the basal and activated states, acting as switch regions. These switch regions may work with the inter-domain twist to initiate and direct arrestin-mediated signaling.},

abstract = {The 14-3-3 proteins, a family of highly conserved scaffolding proteins ubiquitously expressed in all eukaryotic cells, interact with and regulate the function of several hundreds of partner proteins. Yeast neutral trehalases (Nth), enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of trehalose to glucose, compared with trehalases from other organisms, possess distinct structure and regulation involving phosphorylation at multiple sites followed by binding to the 14-3-3 protein. Here we report the crystal structures of yeast Nth1 and its complex with Bmh1 (yeast 14-3-3 isoform), which, together with mutational and fluorescence studies, indicate that the binding of Nth1 by 14-3- 3 triggers Nth1's activity by enabling the proper 3D configuration of Nth1's catalytic and calcium-binding domains relative to each other, thus stabilizing the flexible part of the active site required for catalysis. The presented structure of the Bmh1:Nth1 complex highlights the ability of 14-3-3 to modulate the structure of a multidomain binding partner and to function as an allosteric effector. Furthermore, comparison of the Bmh1:Nth1 complex structure with those of 14-3-3:serotonin N-acetyltransferase and 14-3-3:heat shock protein beta-6 complexes revealed similarities in the 3D structures of bound partner proteins, suggesting the highly conserved nature of 14-3-3 affects the structures of many client proteins.},

In addition, one of the major advantages of this technique is that no tedious purification step is necessary to access the protein of interest. Here, we describe a protocol using MST to determine the binding affinity of the PD-1/PD-L1 couple, which is involved in tumour escape processes, without purification of the target protein from cell lysates. The method requires the overexpression of fluorescent proteins in CHO-K1 cells and describes the optimal conditions for determining the dissociation constant. The protocol has a variety of potential applications in studying the interactions of these proteins with small molecules and demonstrates that MST is a valuable method for studying the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway.},

Complementary to this, we applied pulldown assays as well as microscale thermophoresis as surface immobilization independent techniques. The data revealed that OM64 prefers HSP70 over HSP90, whereas Toc64 binds all chaperones with comparable affinities. We could further show that AtTPR7 is able to bind HSP90 in addition to HSP70. Moreover, differences between the HSP90 isoforms were detected and revealed a weaker binding for HSP90.1 to AtTPR7 and OM64, showing that slight differences in the amino acid composition or structure of the chaperones influence binding to the tetratricopeptide repeat domain. The combinatory approach of several methods provided a powerful toolkit to determine binding affinities of similar interaction partners in a highly quantitative manner.},

abstract = {The Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted via a tick vector, is dependent on its tick and mammalian hosts for a number of essential nutrients. Like other bacterial diderms, it must transport these biochemicals from the extracellular milieu across two membranes, ultimately to the B. burgdorferi cytoplasm. In the current study, we established that a gene cluster comprising genes bb0215 through bb0218 is cotranscribed and is therefore an operon. Sequence analysis of these proteins suggested that they are the components of an ABC-type transporter responsible for translocating phosphate anions from the B. burgdorferi periplasm to the cytoplasm. Biophysical experiments established that the putative ligand-binding protein of this system, BbPstS (BB0215), binds to phosphate in solution. We determined the high-resolution (1.3 {\AA}) crystal structure of the protein in the absence of phosphate, revealing that the protein's fold is similar to other phosphate-binding proteins, and residues that are implicated in phosphate binding in other such proteins are conserved in BbPstS. Taken together, the gene products of bb0215-0218 function as a phosphate transporter for B. burgdorferi.},

abstract = {The first-known aptamer for the stress biomarker cortisol was selected using a tunable stringency magnetic bead selection strategy. The capture DNA probe immobilized on the beads was systematically lengthened to increase the number of bases bound to the complementary pool primer regions following selection enrichment. This resulted in a single sequence (15-1) dominating the final round 15 pool, where the same sequence was the second-highest copy number candidate in the enriched pool with the shorter capture DNA probe (round 13). A thorough analysis of the next-generation sequencing results showed that a high copy number may only correlate with enhanced affinity under certain stringency and enrichment conditions, in contrast with prior published reports. Aptamer 15-1 demonstrated enhanced binding to cortisol (K d = 6.9 ± 2.8 $\mu$M by equilibrium dialysis; 16.1 ± 0.6 $\mu$M by microscale thermophoresis) when compared with the top sequence from round 13 and the negative control progesterone. Whereas most aptamer selections terminate at the selection round demonstrating the highest enrichment, this work shows that extending the selection with higher stringency conditions leads to lower amounts eluted by the target but higher copy numbers of a sequence with enhanced binding. The structure-switching aptamer was applied to a gold nanoparticle assay in buffer and was shown to discriminate between cortisol and two other stress biomarkers, norepinephrine and epinephrine, and a structurally analogous biomarker of liver dysfunction, cholic acid. We believe this approach enhances aptamer selection and serves as proof-of-principle work toward development of point-of-care diagnostics for medical, combat, or bioterrorism targets.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects <70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {Chemical denaturant titrations can be used to accurately determine protein stability. However, data acquisition is typically labour intensive, has low throughput and is difficult to automate. These factors, combined with high protein consumption, have limited the adoption of chemical denaturant titrations in commercial settings. Thermal denaturation assays can be automated, sometimes with very high throughput. However, thermal denaturation assays are incompatible with proteins that aggregate at high temperatures and large extrapolation of stability parameters to physiological temperatures can introduce significant uncertainties.We used capillary-based instruments to measure chemical denaturant titrations by intrinsic fluorescence and microscale thermophoresis. This allowed higher throughput, consumed several hundred-fold less protein than conventional, cuvette-based methods yet maintained the high quality of the conventional approaches.We also established efficient strategies for automated, direct determination of protein stability at a range of temperatures via chemical denaturation, which has utility for characterising stability for proteins that are difficult to purify in high yield. This approach may also have merit for proteins that irreversibly denature or aggregate in classical thermal denaturation assays. We also developed procedures for affinity ranking of protein–ligand interactions from ligand-induced changes in chemical denaturation data, and proved the principle for this by correctly ranking the affinity of previously unreported peptide–PDZ domain interactions. The increased throughput, automation and low protein consumption of protein stability determinations afforded by using capillary-based methods to measure denaturant titrations, can help to revolutionise protein research. We believe that the strategies reported are likely to find wide applications in academia, biotherapeutic formulation and drug discovery programmes.},

In this study, P10 was obtained from Escherichia coli through cloning, expression, and purification. The antiviral agent Ningnanmycin was selected as control, and a series of antiviral compounds based on the structural scaffold of ferulic acid were analyzed. Size-exclusion chromatography analysis results showed that compound F27 can alter the aggregation of P10 proteins. Furthermore, fluorescence titration and microscale thermophoresis assay results indicated that F27 binds to P10 with KA of 5.75×105M-1 and KD of 7.81$\mu$M. The ligand- and receptor-based three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity analyses were performed to determine the requirements for the interaction between the carboxyl structures and P10s. On the basis of the obtained models and information, we provided insights regarding the design and optimization of novel molecules as anti-SRBSDV agents.},

abstract = {Previously we reported the production and charac- terization of monoclonal antibody 1H6 raised against (T4G4)2 intermolecular guanine quadruplex (G4) DNA structures (Henderson A. et al. (2014) Nucleic Acids Res., 42, 860–869; Hoffmann R.F. et al. (2016) Nu- cleic Acids Res., 44, 152–163). It was shown that 1H6 strongly stains nuclei and has exquisite speci- ficity for heterochromatin by immuno-electron mi- croscopy. Here we extend our studies of 1H6 re- activity using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and microscale thermophoresis (MST). As previously reported, 1H6 was found to strongly bind intermolecular G4 structures with a (T4G4)2 sequence motif. However, using both methods we did not de- tect significant binding to G4 structures without thymidines in their sequence motif or to G4 struc- turesmadewith(T2G4)2 oligonucleotides. In addi- tion, we observed strong, sequence-specific bind- ing of 1H6 by ELISA to immobilized single stranded poly(T) DNA but not to immobilized poly(C) or poly(A) homo-polymers. Cross-reactivity of 1H6 to poly(T) was not measured in solution using MST. 1H6 was furthermore found to bind to selected areas on DNA fibers but only after DNA denaturation. Based on these observations we propose that 1H6 binds with high affinity to adjacent T's that are restricted in their movement in selected G4 structures and denatured DNA. Cross-reactivity of 1H6 to immobilized single stranded T-rich DNA next to its previously reported specificity for bona fide G4 structures needs to be taken into account in the interpretation of 1H6 bind- ing to (sub-) cellular structures.},

Using targeted proteomics, we identified proteins that associate with the THO core complex of Arabidopsis TREX. In addition to the RNA helicase UAP56 and the mRNA export factors ALY2-4 and MOS11 we detected interactions with the mRNA export complex TREX-2 and multiple spliceosomal components. Plants defective in the THO component TEX1 or in the mRNA export factor MOS11 (orthologue of human CIP29) are mildly affected. However, tex1 mos11 double-mutant plants show marked defects in vegetative and reproductive development. In tex1 plants, the levels of tasiRNAs are reduced, while miR173 levels are decreased in mos11 mutants. In nuclei of mos11 cells increased mRNA accumulation was observed, while no mRNA export defect was detected with tex1 cells. Nevertheless, in tex1 mos11 double-mutants, the mRNA export defect was clearly enhanced relative to mos11. The subnuclear distribution of TEX1 substantially overlaps with that of splicingrelated SR proteins and in tex1 plants the ratio of certain alternative splicing events is altered. Our results demonstrate that Arabidopsis TEX1 and MOS11 are involved in distinct steps of the biogenesis of mRNAs and small RNAs, and that they interact r},

abstract = {Both iron starvation and excess are detrimental to cellular life, especially for animal and plant pathogens since they always live in iron-limited environments produced by host immune responses. However, how organisms sense and respond to iron is incompletely understood. Herein, we reveal that in the phytopathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas cam- pestris pv. campestris, VgrS (also named ColS) is a membrane-bound receptor histidine kinase that senses extracytoplasmic iron limitation in the periplasm, while its cognate response regulator, VgrR (ColR), detects intracellular iron excess. Under iron-depleted con- ditions, dissociation of Fe3+ from the periplasmic sensor region of VgrS activates the VgrS autophosphorylation and subsequent phosphotransfer to VgrR, an OmpR-family transcrip- tion factor that regulates bacterial responses to take up iron. VgrR-VgrS regulon and the consensus DNA binding motif of the transcription factor VgrR were dissected by compara- tive proteomic and ChIP-seq analyses, which revealed that in reacting to iron-depleted envi- ronments, VgrR directly or indirectly controls the expressions of hundreds of genes that are involved in various physiological cascades, especially those associated with iron-uptake. Among them, we demonstrated that the phosphorylated VgrR tightly represses the tran- scription of a special TonB-dependent receptor gene, tdvA. This regulation is a critical pre- requisite for efficient iron uptake and bacterial virulence since activation of tdvA transcription is detrimental to these processes. When the intracellular iron accumulates, the VgrR-Fe2+ interaction dissociates not only the binding between VgrR and the tdvA promoter, but also the interaction between VgrR and VgrS. This relieves the repression in tdvA transcription to impede continuous iron uptake and avoids possible toxic effects of excessive iron accumu- lation. Our results revealed a signaling system that directly senses both extracytoplasmic and intracellular iron to modulate bacterial iron homeostasis.},

abstract = {Dominant mutations in p97/VCP (valosin-containing protein) cause a rare multisystem degenerative disease with varied phenotypes that include inclusion body myopathy, Paget's disease of bone, frontotemporal dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. p97 disease mutants have altered N-domain conformations, elevated ATPase activity, and altered cofactor association. We have now discovered a previously unidentified disease-relevant functional property of p97 by identifying how the cofactors p37 and p47 regulate p97 ATPase activity. We define p37 as, to our knowledge, the first known p97-activating cofactor, which enhances the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of p97 by 11-fold. Whereas both p37 and p47 decrease the Km of ATP in p97, p37 increases the kcat of p97. In contrast, regulation by p47 is biphasic, with decreased kcat at low levels but increased kcat at higher levels. By deleting a region of p47 that lacks homology to p37 (amino acids 69-92), we changed p47 from an inhibitory cofactor to an activating cofactor, similar to p37. Our data suggest that cofactors regulate p97 ATPase activity by binding to the N domain. Induced conformation changes affect ADP/ATP binding at the D1 domain, which in turn controls ATPase cycling. Most importantly, we found that the D2 domain of disease mutants failed to be activated by p37 or p47. Our results show that cofactors play a critical role in controlling p97 ATPase activity, and suggest that lack of cofactor-regulated communication may contribute to p97-associated disease pathogenesis.},

abstract = {During host infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) encounters several types of stress that impair protein integrity, including reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and chemotherapy. The resulting protein aggregates can be resolved or degraded by molecular machinery conserved from bacteria to eukaryotes. Eukaryotic Hsp104/Hsp70 and their bacterial homologs ClpB/DnaK are ATP-powered chaperones that restore toxic protein aggregates to a native folded state. DnaK is essential in Mycobacterium smegmatis, and ClpB is involved in asymmetrically distributing damaged proteins during cell division as a mechanism of survival in Mtb, commending both proteins as potential drug targets. However, their molecular partners in protein reactivation have not been characterized in mycobacteria. Here, we reconstituted the activities of the Mtb ClpB/DnaK bichaperone system with the cofactors DnaJ1, DnaJ2, and GrpE and the small heat shock protein Hsp20. We found that DnaJ1 and DnaJ2 activate the ATPase activity of DnaK differently. A point mutation in the highly conserved HPD motif of the DnaJ proteins abrogates their ability to activate DnaK, although the DnaJ2 mutant still binds to DnaK. The purified Mtb ClpB/DnaK system reactivated a heat-denatured model substrate, but the DnaJ HPD mutants inhibited the reaction. Finally, either DnaJ1 or DnaJ2 is required for mycobacterial viability, as is the DnaK-activating activity of a DnaJ protein. These studies lay the groundwork for strategies to target essential chaperone-protein interactions in Mtb, the leading cause of death from a bacterial infection.},

abstract = {The availability of well characterized allosteric modulators is of crucial importance for investigating allosteric regulation of protein function. In a recently identified inactive conformation of CDK2 an open allosteric pocket has been detected and proposed as a site to accommodate allosteric inhibitors. Previous structure-based approaches allowed the identification of a hit compound expected to bind to this pocket. Here, we report the characterization of this compound by X-ray crystallography, which surprisingly provided a chemical structure different from the one previously reported. Therefore, the compound was synthesized and completely characterized. X-ray structures of the synthesized and purchased compounds were superimposable. A reaction mechanism was proposed to explain the formation of the structure indicated by X-ray. Moreover, a stereoselective synthesis was developed to evaluate the biological activity of the pure stereoisomers. Modeling studies were performed to unveil the details of the interaction with CDK2. Then, the activity of the obtained compounds was evaluated with different biological assays. Mutagenesis experiments confirmed binding to the allosteric pocket. Finally, the allosteric ligands were shown to inhibit the growth of A549 and SKOV3 cancer cell lines. Therefore, this paper presents a thorough chemical and biological characterization of the first small-molecule ligands to be used as probes to study the allosteric modulation of CDK2 activity.},

We have identified and determined the structure of a stable domain (CHD4-N) in this N-terminal region. The-fold consists of a four-$\alpha$-helix bundle with structural similarity to the high mobility group box, a domain that is well known as a DNA binding module. We show that the CHD4-N domain binds with higher affinity to poly(ADP-ribose) than to DNA. We also show that the N-terminal region of CHD4, although not CHD4-N alone, is essential for full nucleosome remodeling activity and is important for localizing CHD4 to sites of DNA damage. Overall, these data build on our understanding of how CHD4-NuRD acts to regulate gene expression and participates in the DNA-damage response.},

abstract = {Pro-neural transcription factors and small molecules can induce the reprogramming of fibroblasts into functional neurons; however, the immediate-early molecular events that catalyze this conversion have not been well defined. We previously demonstrated that neurogenin 2 (NEUROG2), forskolin (F), and dorsomorphin (D) can reprogram fibroblasts into functional neurons with high efficiency. Here, we??used this model to define the genetic and epigenetic events that initiate an acquisition of neuronal identity. We demonstrate that NEUROG2 is a pioneer factor, FD enhances chromatin accessibility and H3K27 acetylation, and synergistic transcription activated by these factors is essential to successful reprogramming. CREB1 promotes neuron survival and acts with NEUROG2 to upregulate SOX4, which co-activates NEUROD1 and NEUROD4. In addition, SOX4 targets SWI/SNF subunits and SOX4 knockdown results in extensive loss of open chromatin and abolishes reprogramming. Applying these insights, adult human glioblastoma cell and skin fibroblast reprogramming can be improved using SOX4 or chromatin-modifying chemicals.},

LAMP2 deficiency causes Danon's disease, an X-linked hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. LAMP2 is needed for chaperone-mediated autophagy, and its expression improves tissue function in models of aging. We show here that human LAMP1 and LAMP2 bind cholesterol in a manner that buries the cholesterol 3$\beta$-hydroxyl group; they also bind tightly to NPC1 and NPC2 proteins that export cholesterol from lysosomes. Quantitation of cellular LAMP2 and NPC1 protein levels suggest that LAMP proteins represent a significant cholesterol binding site at the lysosome limiting membrane, and may signal cholesterol availability. Functional rescue experiments show that the ability of human LAMP2 to facilitate cholesterol export from lysosomes relies on its ability to bind cholesterol directly.},

Hence the immediacy for discovering new chemical scaffolds to include in combination malaria drug therapy. The desirable attributes of new chemotherapeutic agents currently include activity against both liver and blood stage malaria parasites. One such recently discovered compound called cladosporin abrogates parasite growth via inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum lysyl-tRNA synthetase (PfKRS), an enzyme central to protein translation. Here, we present crystal structure of ternary PfKRS-lysine-cladosporin (PfKRS-K-C) complex that reveals cladosporin's remarkable ability to mimic the natural substrate adenosine and thereby colonize PfKRS active site. The isocoumarin fragment of cladosporin sandwiches between critical adenine-recognizing residues while its pyran ring fits snugly in the ribose-recognizing cavity. PfKRS-K-C structure highlights ample space within PfKRS active site for further chemical derivatization of cladosporin. Such derivatives may be useful against additional human pathogens that retain high conservation in cladosporin chelating residues within their lysyl-tRNA synthetase.},

abstract = {Actin nucleation is the key rate limiting step in the process of actin polymerization, and tight regulation of this process is critical to ensure actin filaments form only at specific times and at defined regions of the cell. Arp2/3 is a well-characterised protein complex that can promote nucleation of new filaments, though its activity requires additional nucleation promotion factors (NPFs). The best recognized of these factors are the WASP family of proteins that contain binding motifs for both monomeric actin and for Arp2/3. Previously we demonstrated that the yeast WASP homologue, Las17, in addition to activating Arp2/3 can also nucleate actin filaments de novo, independently of Arp2/3. This activity is dependent on its polyproline rich region. Through biochemical and in vivo analysis we have now identified key motifs within the polyproline region that are required for nucleation and elongation of actin filaments, and have addressed the role of the WH2 domain in the context of actin nucleation without Arp2/3. We have also demonstrated that full length Las17 is able to bind liposomes giving rise to the possibility of direct linkage of nascent actin filaments to specific membrane sites to which Las17 has been recruited. Overall, we propose that Las17 functions as the key initiator of de novo actin filament formation at endocytic sites by nucleating, elongating and tethering nascent filaments which then serve as a platform for Arp2/3 recruitment and function.},

We report the discovery of ML364, a small molecule inhibitor of the deubiquitinase USP2 and its use to interrogate the biology of USP2 and its putative substrate Cyclin D1. ML364 has an IC50 of 1.1 uM in a biochemical assay using an internally quenched fluorescent di-ubiquitin substrate. Direct binding of ML364 to USP2 was demonstrated using microscale thermophoresis. ML364 induced an increase in cellular Cyclin D1 degradation and caused cell-cycle arrest as shown in western blots and flow cytometry assays utilizing both mino and HCT116 cancer cell lines. ML364, and not the inactive analog 2, was antiproliferative in cancer cell lines. Consistent with the role of Cyclin D1 in DNA damage response, ML364 also caused a decrease in homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair. These effects by a small molecule inhibitor support a key role for USP2 as a regulator of cell cycle, DNA repair and tumor cell growth.},

abstract = {The capacity of Plasmodium falciparum parasitized erythrocytes (pRBC) to adhere to the endothelial lining in the microvasculature and to red blood cells (RBC) is associated with the virulence of the parasite, the pathogenesis and development of severe malaria. Rosetting, the binding of uninfected RBC to pRBC, is frequently observed in individuals with severe malaria and is mediated by the N-terminal NTS-DBL1$\alpha$ domain of the adhesin Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) expressed at the surface of the pRBC. Heparan sulfate has been suggested to be an important receptor for the NTS-DBL1$\alpha$ variant IT4var60 expressed by the parasite FCR3S1.2. Here, we have determined the binding site of NTS-DBL1$\alpha$ (IT4var60) to the RBC and heparin using a set of recombinant, mutated proteins expressed in and purified from E. coli. All the variants were studied for their ability to bind to RBC, their capacities to disrupt FCR3S1.2 rosettes, their affinities for heparin and their binding to rosette-disruptive mAbs. Our results suggest that NTS-DBL1$\alpha$ mediates binding to RBC through a limited number of basic amino acid residues localized on the surface of subdomains 1 (SD1) and 2 (SD2). The SD2-binding site is localized in close proximity to one of two previously identified binding sites in the rosetting PfEMP1 of the parasite PaloAlto-varO. The binding site in SD2 of NTS-DBL1$\alpha$ could represent a template for the development of anti-rosetting drugs.},

abstract = {GPIHBP1 is a glycolipid-anchored membrane protein of capillary endothelial cells that binds lipoprotein lipase (LPL) within the interstitial space and shuttles it to the capillary lumen. The LPL•GPIHBP1 complex is responsible for margination of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins along capillaries and their lipolytic processing. The current work conceptualizes a model for the GPIHBP1•LPL interaction based on biophysical measurements with hydrogen-deuterium exchange/mass spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance, and zero-length cross-linking. According to this model, GPIHBP1 comprises two functionally distinct domains: (1) an intrinsically disordered acidic N-terminal domain; and (2) a folded C-terminal domain that tethers GPIHBP1 to the cell membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol. We demonstrate that these domains serve different roles in regulating the kinetics of LPL binding. Importantly, the acidic domain stabilizes LPL catalytic activity by mitigating the global unfolding of LPL's catalytic domain. This study provides a conceptual framework for understanding intravascular lipolysis and GPIHBP1 and LPL mutations causing familial chylomicronemia.},

Biosensors are emerging technologies in the pharmaceutical field in drug discovery, development and Quality Control (QC) stages; however, they are not yet included in any pharmacopoeia. Surface acoustic wave (SAW) biosensors allow the user to detect and quantify binding events, giving information not only on affinity (KD) and kinetics (kon and koff), but also on viscoelastic effects. We present here an analytical quality by design (aQbD) based approach using somatropin (rhGH, recombinant human growth hormone) and derivatives as model biotechnological drugs and an antibody interaction partner to evaluate the functional quality. Using techniques described in ICH Q2, Q5 and Q8-11, we evaluated the performance of this SAW biosensor technique from a pharmaceutical quality point of view. CMAs (Critical Method Attributes) such as sensitivity, selectivity and variability are evaluated as a function of different experimental variables using DoEs (design of experiments). We suggest qualification tests as well as SSTs (system suitability tests), as required by the pharmaceutical competent authorities and recommend the inclusion of biosensor techniques into the different pharmacopoeia and pharmaceutical guidelines.},

abstract = {Thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) play essential role in DNA synthesis, repair and cell division by catalyzing two subsequent reactions in thymidylate biosynthesis cycle. The lack of either enzyme leads to thymineless death of the cell, therefore inhibition of the enzyme activity is a common and successful tool in cancer chemotherapy and treatment of other diseases. However, the detailed mechanism of thymidylate synthesis cycle, especially the interactions between cycle enzymes and its role remain unknown.In this paper we are the first to show that human TS and DHFR enzymes form a strong complex which might be essential for DNA synthesis. Using two unique biosensor techniques, both highly sensitive to biomolecular interactions, namely quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) and microscale thermophoresis (MST) we have been able to determine DHFR-TS binding kinetic parameters such as the Kd value being below 10$\mu$M (both methods), kon=0.46×104M-1s-1 and koff=0.024s-1 (QCM-D). We also calculated Gibbs free energy as in the order of -30kJ/mol and DHFR/TS molar ratio pointing to binding of 6 DHFR monomers per 1 TS dimer (both methods). Moreover, our data from MST analysis have pointed to positive binding cooperativity in TS-DHFR complex formation. The results obtained with both methods are comparable and complementary. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Aminopeptidases are part of the arsenal of virulence factors produced by bacterial pathogens that inactivate host immune peptides. Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is a genome-reduced pathogen of swine that lacks the genetic repertoire to synthesize amino acids and relies on the host for availability of amino acids for growth. M. hyopneumoniae recruits plasmin(ogen) onto its cell surface via the P97 and P102 adhesins and the glutamyl aminopeptidase MHJ_0125. Plasmin plays an important role in regulating the inflammatory response in the lungs of pigs infected with M. hyopneumoniae. We show that recombinant MHJ_0461 (rMHJ_0461) functions as a leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) with broad substrate specificity for leucine, alanine, phenylalanine, methionine and arginine and that MHJ_0461 resides on the surface of M. hyopneumoniae. rMHJ_0461 also binds heparin, plasminogen and foreign DNA. Plasminogen bound to rMHJ_0461 was readily converted to plasmin in the presence of tPA. Computational modelling identified putative DNA and heparin-binding motifs on solvent-exposed sites around a large pore on the LAP hexamer. We conclude that MHJ_0461 is a LAP that moonlights as a multifunctional adhesin on the cell surface of M. hyopneumoniae.},

abstract = {During mitosis, the spindle checkpoint senses kinetochores not properly attached to spindle microtubules and prevents precocious sister-chromatid separation and aneuploidy. The constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) at inner kinetochores anchors the KMN network consisting of Knl1, the Mis12 complex (Mis12C), and the Ndc80 complex (Ndc80C) at outer kinetochores. KMN is a critical kinetochore receptor for both microtubules and checkpoint proteins. Here, we show that nearly complete inactivation of KMN in human cells through multiple strategies produced strong checkpoint defects even when all kinetochores lacked microtubule attachment. These KMN-inactivating strategies reveal multiple KMN assembly mechanisms at human mitotic kinetochores. In one mechanism, the centromeric kinase Aurora B phosphorylates Mis12C and strengthens its binding to the CCAN subunit CENP-C. In another, CENP-T contributes to KMN attachment in a CENP-H-I-K-dependent manner. Our study provides insights into the mechanisms of mitosis-specific assembly of the checkpoint platform KMN at human kinetochores. \n{\textcopyright} 2015 Kim and Yu.},

Here, we applied computational screening and biochemical analyses to identify molecules that selectively inhibit C4 PEPC, but have no effect on the activity of non-photosynthetic PEPCs.

abstract = {Hageman factor (FXIIa) initiates the intrinsic coagulation pathway and triggers the kallikrein-kinin and the complement systems. In addition, it functions as a growth factor by expressing promitogenic activities toward several cell types. FXIIa binds to the cell surface via a number of structurally unrelated surface receptors; however, the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that FXIIa utilizes cell membrane-bound glycosaminoglycans to interact with the cell surface of human lung fibroblasts (HLF). The combination of enzymatic, inhibitory, and overexpression approaches identified a heparan sulfate (HS) component of proteoglycans as an important determinant of the FXIIa binding capacity of HLF. Moreover, cell-free assays and competition experiments revealed preferential binding of FXIIa to HS and heparin over dextran sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate A and C. Finally, we demonstrate that fibroblasts isolated from the lungs of the patients suffering from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) exhibit enhanced FXIIa binding capacity. Increased sulfation of HS resulting from elevated HS 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 expression in IPF HLF accounted, in part, for this phenomenon. Application of RNA interference technology and inhibitors of intracellular sulfation revealed the cooperative action of cell surface-associated HS and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor in the accumulation of FXIIa on the cell surface of IPF HLF. Moreover, FXIIa stimulated IPF HLF migration, which was abrogated by pretreatment of cells with heparinase I. Collectively, our study uncovers a novel role of HS-type glycosaminoglycans in a local accumulation of FXIIa on the cell membrane. The enhanced association of FXIIa with IPF HLF suggests its contribution to fibrogenesis.},

abstract = {Cytoplasmic $\beta$-actin supports fundamental cellular processes in healthy and diseased cells including cell adhesion, migration, cytokinesis and maintenance of cell polarity. Mutations in ACTB, the gene encoding cytoplasmic $\beta$-actin, lead to severe disorders with a broad range of symptoms. The two dominant heterozygous gain-of-function $\beta$-actin mutations p.R183W and p.E364K were identified in patients with developmental malformations, deafness and juvenile-onset dystonia (p.R183W) and neutrophil dysfunction (p.E364K). Here, we report the recombinant production and functional characterization of the two mutant proteins. Arg183 is located near the nucleotide-binding pocket of actin. Our results from biochemical studies and molecular dynamics simulations show that replacement by a tryptophan residue at position 183 establishes an unusual stacking interaction with Tyr69 that perturbs nucleotide release from actin monomers and polymerization behavior by inducing a closed state conformation. The replacement of Glu364 by a lysine residue appears to act as an allosteric trigger event leading to the preferred formation of the closed state. Thus, our approach indicates that both mutations affect interdomain mobility and nucleotide interactions as a basis for the formation of disease phenotypes in patients.},

abstract = {Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) control many cellular processes and are considered important therapeutic targets. Large collections of inhibitors targeting CDK active sites have been discovered, but their use in chemical biology or drug development has been often hampered by their general lack of specificity. An alternative approach to develop more specific inhibitors is targeting protein interactions involving CDKs. CKS proteins interact with some CDKs and play important roles in cell division. We discovered two small-molecule inhibitors of CDK-CKS interactions. They bind to CDK2, do not inhibit its enzymatic activity, inhibit the proliferation of tumor cell lines, induce an increase in G1 and/or S-phase cell populations, and cause a decrease in CDK2, cyclin A, and p27(Kip1) levels. These molecules should help decipher the complex contributions of CDK-CKS complexes in the regulation of cell division, and they might present an interesting therapeutic potential.},

abstract = {Macrocyclic peptides are potentially a source of powerful drugs, but their de novo discovery remains challenging. Here we describe the discovery of a high-affinity (K d = 10 nM) peptide macrocycle (M21) against human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (hTNF$\alpha$), a key drug target in the treatment of inflammatory disorders, directly from diverse semi-synthetic phage peptide repertoires. The bicyclic peptide M21 (ACPPCLWQVLC) comprises two loops covalently anchored to a 2,4,6-trimethyl-mesitylene core and upon binding induces disassembly of the trimeric TNF$\alpha$ cytokine into dimers and monomers. A 2.9 {\AA} crystal structure of the M21/hTNF$\alpha$ complex reveals the peptide bound to a hTNF$\alpha$ dimer at a normally buried epitope in the trimer interface overlapping the binding site of a previously discov-ered small molecule ligand (SPD304), which also induces TNF trimer dissociation and synergizes with M21 in the inhibition of TNF$\alpha$ cytotoxicity. The discovery of M21 underlines the potential of semi-synthetic bicyclic peptides as ligands for the discovery of cryptic epitopes, some of which are poorly accessible to antibodies.},

We hypothesized that targeted delivery of compounds to the surface of activated endothelial cells (EC) interferes with chemokine/receptor interaction and thereby efficiently blocks inflammation. We developed PEGylated target-sensitive liposomes (TSL) encapsulating a CCR2 antagonist (Teijin compound 1) coupled with a specific peptide recognized by endothelial VCAM-1 (Vp-TSL-Tj). TSL were characterized for size (by dynamic light scattering), the amount of peptide coupled at the liposomal surface and Teijin release (by HPLC). We report that Vp-TSL-Tj binds specifically to activated EC in vitro and in situ, release the entrapped Teijin and prevent the transmigration of monocytes through activated EC. This is the first evidence that nanocarriers which transport and release chemokine inhibitors at specific pathological sites can reduce chemokine-dependent inflammatory processes.},

Oligonucleotide binding surfaces map within a closed cavity of translin octameric barrels, raising the question as to how DNA/RNA gain access to this inner cavity, particularly given that, to date, none of the barrel structures reported hint to an entryway. Here, we argue against a mechanism by which translin octamers may "dissociate and reassemble" upon RNA binding and report a novel "open"-barrel structure of human translin revealing a feasible DNA/RNA entryway into the cavity. Additionally, we report that translin not only is confined to binding of ssDNA oligonucleotides, or single-stranded extensions of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), but also can bind single-stranded sequences internally embedded in dsDNA molecules.},

abstract = {Insects transmit numerous devastating diseases, including malaria, dengue fever, and sleeping sickness. Olfactory cues guide insects to their hosts, and are thus responsible for disease transmission. Understanding the molecular basis of insect olfaction could facilitate the development of interventions. The first step is to heterologously overexpress and purify insect olfactory receptors (ORs). This is challenging, as ORs are membrane proteins. Here, we show that insect ORs and their co-receptor can be expressed in an E. coli cell-free system. After immunoaffinity chromatography, the ORs are $\sim$95% pure, and up to 1 mg/10 ml reaction is obtained. Circular dichroism together with microscale thermophoresis indicate that each receptor is properly folded, and can bind its respective ligand. This is the first time insect ORs have been expressed in an E. coli system. The methods described here could facilitate future structure-function studies, which may aid in developments to alleviate the suffering of millions caused by insect-transmitted diseases.},

For the first time, acute phase protein haptoglobin (Hp) was detected from unpurified meat juice of slaughter pigs by a label-free biosensor-system, the SAW-based sam??5 system. The system uses a sensor chip with specific antibodies to catch Hp while the mass-related phase shift is measured. The concentration is calculated as a function of these measured phase shifts. The results correlate very well with reference measurement results obtained by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), R= 0.98. The robust setup of the surface acoustic wave (SAW)-based system and its ability to measure within very short time periods qualifies it for large-scale analyses and is apt to identify rapidly pigs in the meat production process whose consumption would have an increased risk for consumers. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Post-weaning diarrhea and edema disease caused by F18 fimbriated E. coli are important diseases in newly weaned piglets and lead to severe production losses in farming industry. Protective treatments against these infections have thus far limited efficacy. In this study we generated nanobodies directed against the lectin domain of the F18 fimbrial adhesin FedF and showed in an in vitro adherence assay that four unique nanobodies inhibit the attachment of F18 fimbriated E. coli bacteria to piglet enterocytes. Crystallization of the FedF lectin domain with the most potent inhibitory nanobodies revealed their mechanism of action. These either competed with the binding of the blood group antigen receptor on the FedF surface or induced a conformational change in which the CDR3 region of the nanobody displaces the D″-E loop adjacent to the binding site. This D″-E loop was previously shown to be required for the interaction between F18 fimbriated bacteria and blood group antigen receptors in a membrane context. This work demonstrates the feasibility of inhibiting the attachment of fimbriated pathogens by employing nanobodies directed against the adhesin domain.},

@article{Fonfara2016,
abstract = {CRISPR-Cas systems that provide defence against mobile genetic elements in bacteria and archaea have evolved a variety of mechanisms to target and cleave RNA or DNA. The well-studied types I, II and III utilize a set of distinct CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins for production of mature CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) and interference with invading nucleic acids. In types I and III, Cas6 or Cas5d cleaves precursor crRNA (pre-crRNA) and the mature crRNAs then guide a complex of Cas proteins (Cascade-Cas3, type I; Csm or Cmr, type III) to target and cleave invading DNA or RNA. In type II systems, RNase III cleaves pre-crRNA base-paired with trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) in the presence of Cas9 (refs 13, 14). The mature tracrRNA-crRNA duplex then guides Cas9 to cleave target DNA. Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism in CRISPR-Cas immunity. We show that type V-A Cpf1 from Francisella novicida is a dual-nuclease that is specific to crRNA biogenesis and target DNA interference. Cpf1 cleaves pre-crRNA upstream of a hairpin structure formed within the CRISPR repeats and thereby generates intermediate crRNAs that are processed further, leading to mature crRNAs. After recognition of a 5'-YTN-3' protospacer adjacent motif on the non-target DNA strand and subsequent probing for an eight-nucleotide seed sequence, Cpf1, guided by the single mature repeat-spacer crRNA, introduces double-stranded breaks in the target DNA to generate a 5' overhang. The RNase and DNase activities of Cpf1 require sequence- and structure-specific binding to the hairpin of crRNA repeats. Cpf1 uses distinct active domains for both nuclease reactions and cleaves nucleic acids in the presence of magnesium or calcium. This study uncovers a new family of enzymes with specific dual endoribonuclease and endonuclease activities, and demonstrates that type V-A constitutes the most minimalistic of the CRISPR-Cas systems so far described.},

abstract = {An attractive path forward in proteomics is to experimentally annotate the human protein complement of the genome in a genecentric manner. Using antibodies, it might be possible to design protein-specific probes for a representative protein from every protein-coding gene and to subsequently use the antibodies for systematical analysis of cellular distribution and subcellular localization of proteins in normal and disease tissues. A new version (4.0) of the Human Protein Atlas has been developed in a genecentric manner with the inclusion of all human genes and splice variants predicted from genome efforts together with a visualization of each protein with characteristics such as predicted membrane regions, signal peptide, and protein domains and new plots showing the uniqueness (sequence similarity) of every fraction of each protein toward all other human proteins. The new version is based on tissue profiles generated from 6120 antibodies with more than five million immunohistochemistry-based images covering 5067 human genes, corresponding to approximately 25% of the human genome. Version 4.0 includes a putative list of members in various protein classes, both functional classes, such as kinases, transcription factors, G-protein-coupled receptors, etc., and project-related classes, such as candidate genes for cancer or cardiovascular diseases. The exact antigen sequence for the internally generated antibodies has also been released together with a visualization of the application-specific validation performed for each antibody, including a protein array assay, Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and, for a large fraction, immunofluorescence-based confocal microscopy. New search functionalities have been added to allow complex queries regarding protein expression profiles, protein classes, and chromosome location. The new version of the protein atlas thus is a resource for many areas of biomedical research, including protein science and biomarker discovery.},

abstract = {Temperate viruses can become dormant in their host cells, a process called lysogeny. In every infection, such viruses decide between the lytic and the lysogenic cycles, that is, whether to replicate and lyse their host or to lysogenize and keep the host viable. Here we show that viruses (phages) of the SPbeta group use a small-molecule communication system to coordinate lysis–lysogeny decisions. During infection of its Bacillus host cell, the phage produces a six aminoacids-long communication peptide that is released into the medium. In subsequent infections, progeny phages measure the concentration of this peptide and lysogenize if the concentration is sufficiently high. We found that different phages encode different versions of the communication peptide, demonstrating a phage-specific peptide communication code for lysogeny decisions. We term this communication system the ‘arbitrium' system, and further show that it is encoded by three phage genes: aimP, which produces the peptide; aimR, the intracellular peptide receptor; and aimX, a negative regulator of lysogeny. The arbitrium system enables a descendant phage to ‘communicate' with its predecessors, that is, to estimate the amount of recent previous infections and hence decide whether to employ the lytic or lysogenic cycle.},

Whether BubR1/Bub3 localization to kinetochores in human cells stimulates SAC signalling or only contributes to kinetochore–microtubule interactions is debated. Here we show that two distinct pools of BubR1/Bub3 exist at kinetochores and we uncouple these with defined BubR1/Bub3 mutants to address their function. The major kinetochore pool of BubR1/Bub3 is dependent on direct Bub1/Bub3 binding and is required for chromosome alignment but not for the SAC. A distinct pool of BubR1/Bub3 localizes by directly binding to phosphorylated MELT repeats on the outer kinetochore protein KNL1. When we prevent the direct binding of BubR1/Bub3 to KNL1 the checkpoint is weakened because BubR1/Bub3 is not incorporated into checkpoint complexes efficiently. In conclusion, kinetochore localization supports both known functions of BubR1/Bub3.},

abstract = {Widely recognized as the gold standard for biological recognition, antibodies have been used to develop bioscavengers, enzyme-like catalytic therapies, and highly specific diagnostic clinical tests. The discovery of camelid antibodies in the 1990s has extended the useful range of antibodies into pH extremes, high temperature, and high salt conditions due to increased stability. However, determining the binding properties of these molecules prior to use under these conditions has not been widely employed because the most precise biophysical methods, surface plasmon resonance, and isothermal titration calorimetry, are not compatible with highly complex matrices. Here we demonstrate the use of microscale thermophoresis as a rapid, simple method to detect binding of a single-domain antibody in the presence of jet fuel/water mixes; a complex, harsh environment. This work provides key data to quantifying binding for the development of a sensor for detection of microbial growth in fuel.},

abstract = {Interleukin-1?? (IL-1??) is a key orchestrator in inflammatory and several immune responses. IL-1?? exerts its effects through interleukin-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI) and interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), which together form a heterotrimeric signaling-competent complex. Canakinumab and gevokizumab are highly specific IL-1?? monoclonal antibodies. Canakinumab is known to neutralize IL-1?? by competing for binding to IL-1R and therefore blocking signaling by the antigen:antibody complex. Gevokizumab is claimed to be a regulatory therapeutic antibody that modulates IL-1?? bioactivity by reducing the affinity for its IL-1RI:IL-1RAcP signaling complex. How IL-1?? signaling is affected by both canakinumab and gevokizumab was not yet experimentally determined. We have analyzed the crystal structures of canakinumab and gevokizumab antibody binding fragment (Fab) as well as of their binary complexes with IL-1??. Furthermore, we characterized the epitopes on IL-1?? employed by the antibodies by NMR epitope mapping studies. The direct comparison of NMR and X-ray data shows that the epitope defined by the crystal structure encompasses predominantly those residues whose NMR resonances are severely perturbed upon complex formation. The antigen:Fab co-structures confirm the previously identified key contact residues on IL-1?? and provide insight into the mechanisms leading to their distinct modulation of IL-1?? signaling. A significant steric overlap of the binding interfaces of IL-1R and canakinumab on IL-1?? causes competitive inhibition of the association of IL-1?? and its receptor. In contrast, gevokizumab occupies an allosteric site on IL-1?? and complex formation results in a minor reduction of binding affinity to IL-1RI. This suggests two different mechanisms of IL-1?? pathway attenuation. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {One of the challenges in protein formulation is the simultaneous evaluation of multiple key formulation variables in a rational fashion. The Design of Experiments (DOE) approach has gained significant popularity in protein formulation as well as other process development activities. HTD Biosystems has developed a robust DOE approach for protein formulations referred to as iFormulate™ that utilizes advanced response surface quadratic modeling to evaluate the effects of four formulation variables in a multivariate fashion. The procedure allows for rapid identification of stable protein formulations, using only small amounts of material. By analyzing the thermal stability of a model protein, Lysozyme, using the Prometheus NT.48 in conjunction with the iFormulateTM DOE approach, we demonstrate that ideal formulations can be identified in as little as 35 minutes with minimal sample consumption. The DOE analysis of the precise and reproducible data generated by NanoTemper Technologies Prometheus NT.48 from 25 trial formulations resulted in the identification of the formulation design space for lysozyme formulations with high melting temperatures (Tms). The formulations can be rationalized using Quality by Design principles from the DOE analysis. Thus, by using the predictions from the DOE output and high-precision thermal stability analysis by nanoDSF, stable formulations of proteins can be generated and validated with unprecedented speed and precision.},

We present the structure of the histone H4K20 methyltransferase Suv4-20h2 in complex with its histone H4 peptide substrate and S-adenosyl methionine cofactor. Analysis of the structure reveals that the Suv4-20h2 active site diverges from the canonical SET domain configuration and generates a high degree of both substrate and product specificity. Together with supporting biochemical data comparing Suv4-20h1 and Suv4-20h2, we demonstrate that the Suv4-20 family enzymes take a previously mono-methylated H4K20 substrate and generate an exclusively di-methylated product. We therefore predict that other enzymes are responsible for the tri-methylation of histone H4K20 that marks silenced heterochromatin.},

An anti-Nef single-domain antibody (sdAb19) derived from camelids has been previously generated and shown to effectively block the physiological functions of Nef in vitro and in vivo in nef-transgenic mice. However, sdAb19 must be ectopically expressed within the target cell to be able to exert its neutralizing effect on Nef, while the extra-cellular administration method turned out to be ineffective. This might suggest a default of the stability or/and deliverability of sdAb19. The identification of small molecule compounds capable of inhibiting the Nef-sdAb19 interaction and mimicking the neutralizing activity of sdAb19 in vivo would therefore be the means of circumventing the problem encountered with sdAb19. Here we describe the development of a high-throughput screening method combining the homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) and the microscale thermophoresis (MST) techniques for the identification of small-molecule compounds inhibiting the Nef-sdAb19 interaction by binding to Nef protein. Eight small-molecule compounds have been selected for their ability to significantly inhibit the Nef-sdAb19 interaction and to bind to Nef. These molecules could be further assessed for their potential of being the Nef-neutralizing agents in the future.},

Orthogonal biophysical techniques have been used to prove the "junctional epitope" nature of VHH6, a camelid single domain antibody recognizing the IL-6-gp80 complex but not the individual components alone. X-ray crystallography, HDX-MS and SPR analysis confirmed that the CDR regions of VHH6 interact simultaneously with IL-6 and gp80, locking the two proteins together. At the cellular level, VHH6 was able to alter the response of endothelial cells to exogenous IL-6, promoting a sustained STAT3 phosphorylation signal, an accumulation of IL-6 in vesicles and an overall pro-inflammatory phenotype supported further by transcriptomic analysis. Junctional epitope antibodies, like VHH6, not only offer new opportunities in screening and structure-aided drug discovery, but could also be exploited as therapeutics to modulate complex protein:protein interactions.},

Here, we show that NOP-1 is also able to efficiently disrupt EIN2-ETR1 complex formation in tomato, indicating that the NOP-1 inhibition mode is conserved across plant species. Surface application of NOP-1 on green tomato fruits delays ripening similar to known inhibitors of ethylene perception (MCP) and ethylene biosynthesis (AVG). Fruits treated with NOP-1 showed similar ethylene production as untreated controls underlining that NOP-1 blocks ethylene signaling by targeting an essential interaction in this pathway, while having no effect on ethylene biosynthesis.},

abstract = {In chlorophyll biosynthesis, the magnesium chelatase enzyme complex catalyzes the insertion of a Mg(2+) ion into protoporphyrin IX. Prior to this event, two of the three subunits, the AAA(+) proteins ChlI and ChlD, form a ChlID-MgATP complex. We used microscale thermophoresis to directly determine dissociation constants for the I-D subunits from Synechocystis, and to show that the formation of a ChlID-MgADP complex, mediated by the arginine finger and the sensor II domain on ChlD, is necessary for the assembly of the catalytically active ChlHID-MgATP complex. The N-terminal AAA(+) domain of ChlD is essential for complex formation, but some stability is preserved in the absence of the C-terminal integrin domain of ChlD, particularly if the intervening polyproline linker region is retained. Single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) was used to determine the factors that stabilize formation of the ChlID-MgADP complex at the single molecule level; ChlD was attached to an atomic force microscope (AFM) probe in two different orientations, and the ChlI subunits were tethered to a silica surface; the probability of subunits interacting more than doubled in the presence of MgADP, and we show that the N-terminal AAA(+) domain of ChlD mediates this process, in agreement with the microscale thermophoresis data. Analysis of the unbinding data revealed a most probable interaction force of around 109 pN for formation of single ChlID-MgADP complexes. These experiments provide a quantitative basis for understanding the assembly and function of the Mg chelatase complex.},

abstract = {MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) is a powerful technique to quantify biomolecular interactions. It is based on thermophoresis, the directed movement of molecules in a temperature gradient, which strongly depends on a variety of molecular properties such as size, charge, hydration shell or conformation. Thus, this technique is highly sensitive to virtually any change in molecular properties, allowing for a precise quantification of molecular events independent of the size or nature of the investigated specimen. During a MST experiment, a temperature gradient is induced by an infrared laser. The directed movement of molecules through the temperature gradient is detected and quantified using either covalently attached or intrinsic fluorophores. By combining the precision of fluorescence detection with the variability and sensitivity of thermophoresis, MST provides a flexible, robust and fast way to dissect molecular interactions. In this review, we present recent progress and developments in MST technology and focus on MST applications beyond standard biomolecular interaction studies. By using different model systems, we introduce alternative MST applications - such as determination of binding stoichiometries and binding modes, analysis of protein unfolding, thermodynamics and enzyme kinetics - and also demonstrate the capability of MST to quantify high-affinity interactions with dissociation constants (Kds) in the low picomolar (pM) range as well as protein-protein interactions in pure mammalian cell lysates.},

abstract = {The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) constitutes a focal element in the adaptive immune response against infected or malignantly transformed cells. TAP shuttles proteasomal degradation products into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum for loading of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Here, the heterodimeric TAP complex was purified and reconstituted in nanodiscs in defined stoichiometry. We demonstrate that a single heterodimeric core-TAP complex is active in peptide binding, which is tightly coupled to ATP hydrolysis. Notably, with increasing peptide length, the ATP turnover was gradually decreased, revealing that ATP hydrolysis is coupled to the movement of peptide through the ATP-binding cassette transporter. In addition, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations show that the observed 22 lipids are sufficient to form an annular belt surrounding the TAP complex. This lipid belt is essential for high affinity inhibition by the herpesvirus immune evasin ICP47. In conclusion, nanodiscs are a powerful approach to study the important role of lipids as well as the function, interaction, and modulation of the antigen translocation machinery.},

abstract = {As ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) plays a crucial role in nucleic acid metabolism, it is an important target for anticancer therapy. The thiosemicarbazone Triapine is an efficient R2 inhibitor, which has entered approximately 20 clinical trials. Thiosemicarbazones are supposed to exert their biological effects through effectively binding transition-metal ions. In this study, six iminodiacetate-thiosemicarbazones able to form transition-metal complexes, as well as six dicopper(II) complexes, were synthesized and fully characterized by analytical, spectroscopic techniques (IR, UV-vis; 1H and 13C NMR), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and X-ray diffraction. The antiproliferative effects were examined in several human cancer and one noncancerous cell lines. Several of the compounds showed high cytotoxicity and marked selectivity for cancer cells. On the basis of this, and on molecular docking calculations one lead dicopper(II) complex and one thiosemicarbazone were chosen for in vitro analysis as potential R2 inhibitors. Their interaction with R2 and effect on the Fe(III)2-Y. cofactor were characterized by microscale thermophoresis, and two spectroscopic techniques, namely, electron paramagnetic resonance and UV-vis spectroscopy. Our findings suggest that several of the synthesized proligands and copper(II) complexes are effective antiproliferative agents in several cancer cell lines, targeting RNR, which deserve further investigation as potential anticancer drugs.},

abstract = {The characterization and development of highly specific aptamers requires the analysis of the interaction strength between aptamer and target. MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) is a rapid and precise method to quantify biomolecular interactions in solution at microliter scale. The basis of this technology is a physical effect referred to as thermophoresis, which describes the directed movement of molecules through temperature gradients. The thermophoretic properties of a molecule depend on its size, charge, and hydration shell. Since at least one of these parameters is altered upon binding of a ligand, this method can be used to analyze virtually any biomolecular interaction in any buffer or complex bioliquid. This section provides a detailed protocol describing how MST is used to obtain quantitative binding parameters for aptamer-target interactions. The two DNA-aptamers HD1 and HD22, which are targeted against human thrombin, are used as model systems to demonstrate a rapid and straightforward screening approach to determine optimal buffer conditions.},

abstract = {The AT-hook has been defined as a DNA binding peptide motif that contains a glycine-arginine-proline (G-R-P) tripeptide core flanked by basic amino acids. Recent reports documented variations in the sequence of AT-hooks and revealed RNA binding activity of some canonical AT-hooks, suggesting a higher structural and functional variability of this protein domain than previously anticipated. Here we describe the discovery and characterization of the extended AT-hook peptide motif (eAT-hook), in which basic amino acids appear symmetrical mainly at a distance of 12-15 amino acids from the G-R-P core. We identified 80 human and 60 mouse eAT-hook proteins and biochemically characterized the eAT-hooks of Tip5/BAZ2A, PTOV1 and GPBP1. Microscale thermophoresis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays reveal the nucleic acid binding features of this peptide motif, and show that eAT-hooks bind RNA with one order of magnitude higher affinity than DNA. In addition, cellular localization studies suggest a role for the N-terminal eAT-hook of PTOV1 in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. In summary, our findings classify the eAT-hook as a novel nucleic acid binding motif, which potentially mediates various RNA-dependent cellular processes.},

abstract = {The DEAD-box protein UAP56 (U2AF65-associcated protein) is an RNA helicase that in yeast and metazoa is critically involved in mRNA splicing and export. In Arabidopsis, two adjacent genes code for an identical UAP56 protein, and both genes are expressed. In case one of the genes is inactivated by a T-DNA insertion, wild type transcript level is maintained by the other intact gene. In contrast to other organisms that are severely affected by elevated UAP56 levels, Arabidopsis plants that overexpress UAP56 have wild type appearance. UAP56 localises predominantly to euchromatic regions of Arabidopsis nuclei, and associates with genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II independently from the presence of introns, while it is not detected at non-transcribed loci. Biochemical characterisation revealed that in addition to ssRNA and dsRNA, UAP56 interacts with dsDNA, but not with ssDNA. Moreover, the enzyme displays ATPase activity that is stimulated by RNA and dsDNA and it has ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity unwinding dsRNA, whereas it does not unwind dsDNA. Protein interaction studies showed that UAP56 directly interacts with the mRNA export factors ALY2 and MOS11, suggesting that it is involved in mRNA export from plant cell nuclei.},

Here, we present the crystal structure of the human Myo1c motor in complex with its light chain calmodulin. Our structure reveals tight interactions of the motor domain with calmodulin bound to the first IQ motif in the neck region. Several of the calmodulin residues contributing to this interaction are also involved in Ca2+ binding. Contact residues in the motor domain are linked to the central $\beta$-sheet and the HO helix, suggesting a mechanism for communicating changes in Ca2+ binding in the neck region to the actin and nucleotide binding regions of the motor domain. The structural context and the chemical environment of Myo1c mutations that are involved in sensorineural hearing loss in humans are described and their impact on motor function is discussed. We show that a construct consisting of the motor domain of Myo1c and the first IQ motif is sufficient to establish a tight interaction with 14-3-3$\beta$ (KD = 0.9 $\mu$M) and present the model of a double-headed Myo1c–14-3-3 complex.

The main goal of this study was to develop an approach for predicting protein targets for chemical toxins using a molecular similarity search of toxin-target information collected in the Toxin and Toxin-Target Database. The developed method was used to identify new targets for toluene which could predict potential cellular toxicity and to validate the approach with in vitro laboratory studies. We obtained 124 potential targets for toluene from a molecular similarity search. Results were further analysed using in silico molecular docking methods. The binding of toluene to two proteins, hemoglobin and serum albumin, was validated by the measurement of binding using microscale thermophoresis. The measured binding constant between toluene and hemoglobin was 1.9 [small mu ]M, while albumin demonstrated toluene-induced aggregation. These results demonstrate the applicability of an exploratory in silico toxicity tool, based on a molecular similarity search and protein-ligand docking for identification of potential targets for chemical toxins.},

In response to falling nitrate levels, NRT1.1 is phosphorylated on an intracellular threonine that switches the transporter from a low-affinity to high-affinity state. Here we present both the apo and nitrate-bound crystal structures of Arabidopsis thaliana NRT1.1, which together with in vitro binding and transport data identify a key role for His[thinsp]356 in nitrate binding. Our data support a model whereby phosphorylation increases structural flexibility and in turn the rate of transport. Comparison with peptide transporters further reveals how the NRT1/PTR family has evolved to recognize diverse nitrogenous ligands, while maintaining elements of a conserved coupling mechanism within this superfamily of nutrient transporters.},

Tim-Tipin is suggested to be recruited to replication forks via Replication Protein A (RPA) but details of the interaction are unknown. Here, using cryo-EM and biochemical methods, we characterized complex formation of Tim-Tipin, RPA and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Tim-Tipin and RPA form a 258 kDa complex with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry. The cryo-EM 3D reconstruction revealed a globular architecture of the Tim-Tipin-RPA complex with a ring-like and a U-shaped domain covered by a RPA lid. Interestingly, RPA in the complex adopts a horse shoe-like shape resembling its conformation in the presence of long ssDNA (>30 nucleotides). Furthermore, the recruitment of the Tim-Tipin-RPA complex to ssDNA is modulated by the RPA conformation and requires RPA to be in the more compact 30 nt ssDNA binding mode. The dynamic formation and disruption of the Tim-Tipin-RPA-ssDNA complex implicates the RPA-based recruitment of Tim-Tipin to the replication fork.},

In this study, an emerging new approach microscale thermophoresis and conventional ThT fluorescence assay were utilized to investigate the aggregation behavior of hIAPP11–20, giving a new insight of the solvent effect on the aggregation of hIAPP11–20. hIAPP11–20 displayed different aggregation behaviors in various buffers, revealing that hIAPP11–20 not only self-aggregates but also binds to solvent components. hIAPP11–20 had a higher binding affinity for Tris than other selected buffers because multiple hydrogen bonds form, resulting in weaker self-aggregation of hIAPP11–20 at the early stage of aggregation and prolonging the fibril formation process. hIAPP11–20 displayed similar self-aggregation in both HEPES and pure water. Negatively charged phosphate ions in the PBS solution ‘neutralize' the charges carried by hIAPP11–20 itself to some extent, causing rapid aggregation of hIAPP11–20, and leading to a shorter fibrillation process of hIAPP11–20. These results revealed that solvents contribute to the aggregation of hIAPP11–20 and demonstrated the affect of solvents on the activity of biomolecules. Additionally, as a new technique, microscale thermophoresis offers a powerful and promising approach to study the early stages of aggregation of peptides or proteins.},

We describe here the synthesis and testing of potential small-molecule pan-RAS ligands, which were designed to interact with adjacent sites on the surface of oncogenic KRAS. One compound, termed 3144, was found to bind to RAS proteins using microscale thermophoresis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry and to exhibit lethality in cells partially dependent on expression of RAS proteins. This compound was metabolically stable in liver microsomes and displayed anti-tumor activity in xenograft mouse cancer models. These findings suggest that pan-RAS inhibition may be an effective therapeutic strategy for some cancers and that structure-based design of small molecules targeting multiple adjacent sites to create multivalent inhibitors may be effective for some proteins.},

abstract = {Microscale thermophoresis (MST) allows for quantitative analysis of protein interactions in free solution and with low sample consumption. The technique is based on thermophoresis, the directed motion of molecules in temperature gradients. Thermophoresis is highly sensitive to all types of binding-induced changes of molecular properties, be it in size, charge, hydration shell or conformation. In an all-optical approach, an infrared laser is used for local heating, and molecule mobility in the temperature gradient is analyzed via fluorescence. In standard MST one binding partner is fluorescently labeled. However, MST can also be performed label-free by exploiting intrinsic protein UV-fluorescence. Despite the high molecular weight ratio, the interaction of small molecules and peptides with proteins is readily accessible by MST. Furthermore, MST assays are highly adaptable to fit to the diverse requirements of different biomolecules, such as membrane proteins to be stabilized in solution. The type of buffer and additives can be chosen freely. Measuring is even possible in complex bioliquids like cell lysate allowing close to in vivo conditions without sample purification. Binding modes that are quantifiable via MST include dimerization, cooperativity and competition. Thus, its flexibility in assay design qualifies MST for analysis of biomolecular interactions in complex experimental settings, which we herein demonstrate by addressing typically challenging types of binding events from various fields of life science.},

Here, we developed a strategy for covalent N-terminal intein-mediated protein labeling at (sub) nanomolar probe concentrations. Combined with a minimal synthetic lock-and-key element, the affinity between the intein fragments was increased to 10 nM.

abstract = {Toxin A (TcdA) and B (TcdB) from Clostridium difficile enter host cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. A prerequisite for proper toxin action is the intracellular release of the glucosyltransferase domain by an inherent cysteine protease, which is allosterically activated by inositol hexaphosphate (IP6). We found that in in vitro assays, the C-terminally-truncated TcdA1–1065 was more efficient at IP6-induced cleavage compared with full-length TcdA. We hypothesized that the C-terminally-located combined repetitive oligopeptides (CROPs) interact with the N-terminal part of the toxin, thereby preventing autoproteolysis. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays and microscale thermophoresis confirmed binding between the CROPs and the glucosyltransferase (TcdA1–542) or intermediate (TcdA1102–1847) domain of TcdA, respectively. This interaction between the N- and C-terminus was not found for TcdB. Functional assays revealed that TcdB was more susceptible to inactivation by extracellular IP6-induced cleavage. In vitro autoprocessing and inactivation of TcdA, however, significantly increased, either by acidification of the surrounding milieu or following exchange of its CROP domain by the homologous CROP domain of TcdB. Thus, TcdA CROPs contribute to the stabilization and protection of toxin conformation in addition to function as the main receptor binding domain.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to determine whether the guluronate (G) rich alginate OligoG CF-5/20 (OligoG) could detach cystic fibrosis (CF) mucus by calcium chelation, which is also required for normal mucin unfolding. Since bicarbonate secretion is impaired in CF, leading to insufficient mucin unfolding and thereby attached mucus and since bicarbonate has the ability to bind calcium, we hypothesized that the calcium chelating property of OligoG would lead to detachment of CF mucus. Indeed, OligoG could compete with the N-terminus of the MUC2 mucin for calcium binding as shown by microscale thermophoresis. Further, effects on mucus thickness and attachment induced by OligoG and other alginate fractions of different length and composition were evaluated in explants of CF mouse ileum mounted in horizontal Ussing-type chambers. OligoG at 1.5% caused effective detachment of CF mucus and the most potent alginate fraction tested, the poly-G fraction of about 12 residues, had similar potency compared to OligoG whereas mannuronate-rich (M) polymers had minimal effect. In conclusion, OligoG binds calcium with appropriate affinity without any overt harmful effect on the tissue and can be exploited for treating mucus stagnation.

STAT3 is constitutively phosphorylated in various cancers and drives gene expression from GAS-containing promoters to promote tumorigenesis. Recently, roles for unphosphorylated STAT3 (U-STAT3) have been described in response to cytokine stimulation, in cancers, and in maintenance of heterochromatin stability. However, the mechanisms underlying U-STAT3 binding to DNA has not been fully investigated. Here, we explore STAT3-DNA interactions by atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. We observed that U-STAT3 molecules bind to the GAS DNA-binding site as dimers and monomers. In addition, we observed that U-STAT3 binds to AT-rich DNA sequence sites and recognizes specific DNA structures, such as 4-way junctions and DNA nodes, within negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA. These structures are important for chromatin organization and our data suggest a role for U-STAT3 as a chromatin/genome organizer. Unexpectedly, we found that a C-terminal truncated 67.5-kDa STAT3 isoform recognizes single-stranded spacers within cruciform structures that also have a role in chromatin organization and gene expression. This isoform appears to be abundant in the nuclei of cancer cells and, therefore, may have a role in regulation of gene expression. Taken together, our data highlight novel mechanisms by which U-STAT3 binds to DNA and supports U-STAT3 function as a transcriptional activator and a chromatin/genomic organizer.},

Peptide-receptor matching is important for understanding the mechanisms underlying peptide-mediated signaling. Here we report the structure-guided identification of root meristem growth factor (RGF) receptors important for plant development. An assay based on a signature ligand recognition motif (Arg-x-Arg) conserved in a subfamily of leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs) identified the functionally uncharacterized LRR-RK At4g26540 as a receptor of RGF1 (RGFR1). We further solved the crystal structure of RGF1 in complex with the LRR domain of RGFR1 at a resolution of 2.6 A, which reveals that the Arg-x-Gly-Gly (RxGG) motif is responsible for specific recognition of the sulfate group of RGF1 by RGFR1. Based on the RxGG motif, we identified additional four RGFRs. Participation of the five RGFRs in RGF-induced signaling is supported by biochemical and genetic data. We also offer evidence showing that SERKs function as co-receptors for RGFs. Taken together, our study identifies RGF receptors and co-receptors that can link RGF signals with their downstream components and provides a proof of principle for structure-based matching of LRR-RKs with their peptide ligands.},

abstract = {Bacterial tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (Tgt) catalyses the exchange of the genetically encoded guanine at the wobble position of tRNAs(His,Tyr,Asp,Asn) by the premodified base preQ1, which is further converted to queuine at the tRNA level. As eucaryotes are not able to synthesise queuine de novo but acquire it through their diet, eucaryotic Tgt directly inserts the hypermodified base into the wobble position of the tRNAs mentioned above. Bacterial Tgt is required for the efficient pathogenicity of Shigella sp, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery and, hence, it constitutes a putative target for the rational design of anti-Shigellosis compounds. Since mammalian Tgt is known to be indirectly essential to the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, it is necessary to create substances which only inhibit bacterial but not eucaryotic Tgt. Therefore, it seems of utmost importance to study selectivity-determining features within both types of proteins. Homology models of Caenorhabditis elegans Tgt and human Tgt suggest that the replacement of Cys158 and Val233 in bacterial Tgt (Zymomonas mobilis Tgt numbering) by valine and accordingly glycine in eucaryotic Tgt largely accounts for the different substrate specificities. In the present study we have created mutated variants of Z. mobilis Tgt in order to investigate the impact of a Cys158Val and a Val233Gly exchange on catalytic activity and substrate specificity. Using enzyme kinetics and X-ray crystallography, we gained evidence that the Cys158Val mutation reduces the affinity to preQ1 while leaving the affinity to guanine unaffected. The Val233Gly exchange leads to an enlarged substrate binding pocket, that is necessary to accommodate queuine in a conformation compatible with the intermediately covalently bound tRNA molecule. Contrary to our expectations, we found that a priori queuine is recognised by the binding pocket of bacterial Tgt without, however, being used as a substrate.},

abstract = {The opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa controls host innate immune and complement attack. Here we identify Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (Lpd), a 57 kDa moonlighting protein, as the first P. aeruginosa protein that binds the two human terminal pathway inhibitors vitronectin and clusterin. Both human regulators when bound to the bacterium inhibited effector function of the terminal complement, blocked C5b-9 deposition and protected the bacterium from complement damage. P. aeruginosa when challenged with complement active human serum depleted from vitronectin was severely damaged and bacterial survival was reduced by over 50%. Similarly, when in human serum clusterin was blocked by a mAb, bacterial survival was reduced by 44%. Thus, demonstrating that Pseudomonas benefits from attachment of each human regulator and controls complement attack. The Lpd binding site in vitronectin was localized to the C-terminal region, i.e. to residues 354-363. Thus, Lpd of P. aeruginosa is a surface exposed moonlighting protein that binds two human terminal pathway inhibitors, vitronectin and clusterin and each human inhibitor when attached protected the bacterial pathogen from the action of the terminal complement pathway. Our results showed insights into the important function of Lpd as a complement regulator binding protein that might play an important role in virulence of P. aeruginosa.},

abstract = {The ubiquitylation signal promotes trafficking of endogenous and retroviral transmembrane proteins. The signal is decoded by a large set of ubiquitin (Ub) receptors that tether Ub-binding domains (UBDs) to the trafficking machinery. We developed a structure-based procedure to scan the protein data bank for hidden UBDs. The screen retrieved many of the known UBDs. Intriguingly, new potential UBDs were identified, including the ALIX-V domain. Pull-down, cross-linking and E3-independent ubiquitylation assays biochemically corroborated the in silico findings. Guided by the output model, we designed mutations at the postulated ALIX-V:Ub interface. Biophysical affinity measurements using microscale-thermophoresis of wild-type and mutant proteins revealed some of the interacting residues of the complex. ALIX-V binds mono-Ub with a K(d) of 119 muM. We show that ALIX-V oligomerizes with a Hill coefficient of 5.4 and IC(50) of 27.6 muM and that mono-Ub induces ALIX-V oligomerization. Moreover, we show that ALIX-V preferentially binds K63 di-Ub compared with mono-Ub and K48 di-Ub. Finally, an in vivo functionality assay demonstrates the significance of ALIX-V:Ub interaction in equine infectious anaemia virus budding. These results not only validate the new procedure, but also demonstrate that ALIX-V directly interacts with Ub in vivo and that this interaction can influence retroviral budding.},

abstract = {LiaR is a 'master regulator' of the cell envelope stress response in enterococci and many other Gram-positive organisms. Mutations to liaR can lead to antibiotic resistance to a variety of antibiotics including the cyclic lipopeptide daptomycin. LiaR is phosphorylated in response to membrane stress to regulate downstream target operons. Using DNA footprinting of the regions upstream of the liaXYZ and liaFSR operons we show that LiaR binds an extended stretch of DNA that extends beyond the proposed canonical consensus sequence suggesting a more complex level of regulatory control of target operons. We go on to determine the biochemical and structural basis for increased resistance to daptomycin by the adaptive mutation to LiaR (D191N) first identified from the pathogen Enterococcus faecalis S613. LiaR(D191N) increases oligomerization of LiaR to form a constitutively activated tetramer that has high affinity for DNA even in the absence of phosphorylation leading to increased resistance. Crystal structures of the LiaR DNA binding domain complexed to the putative consensus sequence as well as an adjoining secondary sequence show that upon binding, LiaR induces DNA bending that is consistent with increased recruitment of RNA polymerase to the transcription start site and upregulation of target operons.},

abstract = {Receptor tyrosine kinase activity is known to occur in the absence of extracellular stimuli. Importantly, this "background" level of receptor phosphorylation is insufficient to effect a downstream response, suggesting that strict controls are present and prohibit full activation. Here a mechanism is described in which control of FGFR2 activation is provided by the adaptor protein Grb2. Dimeric Grb2 binds to the C termini of two FGFR2 molecules. This heterotetramer is capable of a low-level receptor transphosphorylation, but C-terminal phosphorylation and recruitment of signaling proteins are sterically hindered. Upon stimulation, FGFR2 phosphorylates tyrosine residues on Grb2, promoting dissociation from the receptor and allowing full activation of downstream signaling. These observations establish a role for Grb2 as an active regulator of RTK signaling.},

abstract = {Ras GTPases regulate intracellular signaling involved in cell proliferation. Elevated Ras signaling activity has been associated with human cancers. Ras activation is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), of which SOS1 is a major member that transduces receptor tyrosine kinase signaling to Ras. We have developed a rational approach coupling virtual screening with experimental screening in identifying small-molecule inhibitors targeting the catalytic site of SOS1 and SOS1-regulated Ras activity. A lead inhibitor, NSC-658497, was found to bind to SOS1, competitively suppress SOS1-Ras interaction, and dose-dependently inhibit SOS1 GEF activity. Mutagenesis and structure-activity relationship studies map the NSC-658497 site of action to the SOS1 catalytic site, and define the chemical moieties in the inhibitor essential for the activity. NSC-658497 showed dose-dependent efficacy in inhibiting Ras, downstream signaling activities, and associated cell proliferation. These studies establish a proof of principle for rational design of small-molecule inhibitors targeting Ras GEF enzymatic activity.},

However, very little is known about how evolution has favored conservation of functions for some isoforms, while also allowing for the generation of new recognition sites and specialized cellular functions. Here we present several crystal structures of the myosin Va or the myosin Vb globular tail domain (GTD) that gives insights into how the motor is linked to the recycling membrane compartments via Rab11 or to the melanosome membrane via recognition of the melanophilin adaptor that binds to Rab27a. The structures illustrate how the Rab11-binding site has been conserved during evolution and how divergence at another site of the GTD allows more specific interactions such as the specific recognition of melanophilin by the myosin Va isoform. With atomic structural insights, these structures also show how either the partner or the GTD structural plasticity upon association is critical for selective recruitment of the motor.},

We describe the first crystal structure of a cytokine-directed human IgG1lambda autoantibody-binding fragment (Fab) at 1.9 A (1 A=0.1 nm) resolution. Its CDR3-H substantially differs from all VH7 germline IgG1 structures reported previously. We derive a reliable model of the antigen-autoantibody complex by using NMR chemical shift perturbation data in combination with computational methods. Superposition of the modelled complex structure with the human GM-CSF-GM-CSF ternary receptor complex reveals only little overlap between receptor and Fab when bound to GM-CSF. Our model provides a structural basis for understanding the mode of action of the MB007 autoantibody.},

abstract = {In addition to the catalytically active kinase domain, most kinases feature regulatory domains that govern their activity. Modulating and interfering with these interdomain interactions presents a major opportunity for understanding biological systems and developing novel therapeutics. Therefore, small molecule inhibitors that target these interactions through an allosteric mode of action have high intrinsic selectivity, as these interactions are often unique to a single kinase or kinase family. Here we report the development of iFLiK (interface-Fluorescent Labels in Kinases), a fluorescence-based assay that can monitor such interdomain interactions. Using iFLiK, we have demonstrated selective detection of allosteric Akt inhibitors that induce an inactive closed conformation unique to Akt. This methodology easily distinguished small molecule allosteric inhibitors from classic ATP-competitive inhibitors. Screening an in-house compound library with iFLiK, we were able to identify novel compounds with a scaffold that has not been previously described for allosteric Akt inhibitors.},

abstract = {The signal recognition particle (SRP) recognizes signal sequences of nascent polypeptides and targets ribosome-nascent chain complexes to membrane translocation sites. In eukaryotes, translating ribosomes are slowed down by the Alu domain of SRP to allow efficient targeting. In prokaryotes, however, little is known about the structure and function of Alu domain-containing SRPs. Here, we report a complete molecular model of SRP from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, based on cryo-EM. The SRP comprises two subunits, 6S RNA and SRP54 or Ffh, and it facilitates elongation slowdown similarly to its eukaryotic counterpart. However, protein contacts with the small ribosomal subunit observed for the mammalian Alu domain are substituted in bacteria by RNA-RNA interactions of 6S RNA with the [alpha]-sarcin-ricin loop and helices H43 and H44 of 23S rRNA. Our findings provide a structural basis for cotranslational targeting and RNA-driven elongation arrest in prokaryotes.},

abstract = {Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) are essential enzymes catalyzing the formation of aminoacyl-tRNAs, the immediate precursors for encoded peptides in ribosomal protein synthesis. Previous studies have suggested a link between tRNA aminoacylation and high-molecular-weight cellular complexes such as the cytoskeleton or ribosomes. However, the structural basis of these interactions and potential mechanistic implications are not well understood. To biochemically characterize these interactions we have used a system of two interacting archaeal aaRSs: an atypical methanogenic-type seryl-tRNA synthetase and an archaeal ArgRS. More specifically, we have shown by thermophoresis and surface plasmon resonance that these two aaRSs bind to the large ribosomal subunit with micromolar affinities. We have identified the L7/L12 stalk and the proteins located near the stalk base as the main sites for aaRS binding. Finally, we have performed a bioinformatics analysis of synonymous codons in the Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus genome that supports a mechanism in which the deacylated tRNAs may be recharged by aaRSs bound to the ribosome and reused at the next occurrence of a codon encoding the same amino acid. These results suggest a mechanism of tRNA recycling in which aaRSs associate with the L7/L12 stalk region to recapture the tRNAs released from the preceding ribosome in polysomes.},

abstract = {<p>The characterization of phosphotyrosine mediated protein-protein interactions is vital for the interpretation of downstream pathways of transmembrane signaling processes. Currently however, there is a gap between the initial identification and characterization of cellular binding events by proteomic methods and the in vitro generation of quantitative binding information in the form of equilibrium rate constants (K<sub>d</sub> values). In this work we present a systematic, accelerated and simplified approach to fill this gap: using cell-free protein synthesis with site-specific labeling for pull-down and microscale thermophoresis (MST) we were able to validate interactions and to establish a binding hierarchy based on K<sub>d</sub> values as a completion of existing proteomic data sets. As a model system we analyzed SH2-mediated interactions of the human T-cell phosphoprotein ADAP. Putative SH2 domain-containing binding partners were synthesized from a cDNA library using Expression-PCR with site-specific biotinylation in order to analyze their interaction with fluorescently labeled and <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylated ADAP by pull-down. On the basis of the pull-down results, selected SH2's were subjected to MST to determine K<sub>d</sub> values. In particular, we could identify an unexpectedly strong binding of ADAP to the previously found binding partner Rasa1 of about 100 nM, while no evidence of interaction was found for the also predicted SH2D1A. Moreover, K<sub>d</sub> values between ADAP and its known binding partners SLP-76 and Fyn were determined. Next to expanding data on ADAP suggesting promising candidates for further analysis <italic>in vivo</italic>, this work marks the first K<sub>d</sub> values for phosphotyrosine/SH2 interactions on a phosphoprotein level.</p>},

abstract = {Lipochitin oligosaccharides called Nod factors function as primary rhizobial signal molecules triggering legumes to develop new plant organs: root nodules that host the bacteria as nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. Here, we show that the Lotus japonicus Nod factor receptor 5 (NFR5) and Nod factor receptor 1 (NFR1) bind Nod factor directly at high-affinity binding sites. Both receptor proteins were posttranslationally processed when expressed as fusion proteins and extracted from purified membrane fractions of Nicotiana benthamiana or Arabidopsis thaliana. The N-terminal signal peptides were cleaved, and NFR1 protein retained its in vitro kinase activity. Processing of NFR5 protein was characterized by determining the N-glycosylation patterns of the ectodomain. Two different glycan structures with identical composition, Man(3)XylFucGlcNAc(4), were identified by mass spectrometry and located at amino acid positions N68 and N198. Receptor-ligand interaction was measured by using ligands that were labeled or immobilized by application of chemoselective chemistry at the anomeric center. High-affinity ligand binding was demonstrated with both solid-phase and free solution techniques. The K(d) values obtained for Nod factor binding were in the nanomolar range and comparable to the concentration range sufficient for biological activity. Structure-dependent ligand specificity was shown by using chitin oligosaccharides. Taken together, our results suggest that ligand recognition through direct ligand binding is a key step in the receptor-mediated activation mechanism leading to root nodule development in legumes.},

Most of currently available methods of KD determination require access to purified protein of interest, generation of which can be time-consuming and expensive. We have developed a protocol that allows for determination of binding affinity by microscale thermophoresis (MST) without purification of the target protein from cell lysates. The method involves overexpression of the GFP-fused protein and cell lysis in non-denaturing conditions. Application of the method to STAT3-GFP transiently expressed in HEK293 cells allowed to determine for the first time the affinity of the well-studied transcription factor to oligonucleotides with different sequences. The protocol is straightforward and can have a variety of application for studying interactions of proteins with small molecules, peptides, DNA, RNA, and proteins.},

abstract = {The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an essential cell signaling system that detects the accumulation of misfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and initiates a cellular response in order to maintain homeostasis. How cells detect the accumulation of misfolded proteins remains unclear. In this study, we identify a noncanonical interaction between the ATPase domain of the ER chaperone BiP and the luminal domains of the UPR sensors Ire1 and Perk that dissociates when authentic ER unfolded protein CH1 binds to the canonical substrate binding domain of BiP. Unlike the interaction between chaperone and substrates, we found that the interaction between BiP and UPR sensors was unaffected by nucleotides. Thus, we discover that BiP is dual functional UPR sensor, sensing unfolded proteins by canonical binding to substrates and transducing this event to noncanonical, signaling interaction to Ire1 and Perk. Our observations implicate BiP as the key component for detecting ER stress and suggest an allosteric mechanism for UPR induction.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03522.001Author keywordsResearch organism},

In Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli, this step implies the invagination of three biological layers (cytoplasmic membrane, peptidoglycan and outer membrane), biosynthesis of the new poles and eventually, daughter cells separation. The latter requires the coordinated action of the N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine amidases AmiA/B/C and their LytM activators EnvC and NlpD to cleave the septal peptidoglycan. We present here the 2.5 A crystal structure of AmiC which includes the first report of an AMIN domain structure, a beta-sandwich of two symmetrical four-stranded beta-sheets exposing highly conserved motifs on the two outer faces. We show that this N-terminal domain, involved in the localization of AmiC at the division site, is a new peptidoglycan-binding domain. The C-terminal catalytic domain shows an auto-inhibitory alpha helix obstructing the active site. AmiC lacking this helix exhibits by itself an activity comparable to that of the wild type AmiC activated by NlpD. We also demonstrate the interaction between AmiC and NlpD by microscale thermophoresis and confirm the importance of the active site blocking alpha helix in the regulation of the amidase activity.},

The high genetic variability ofHCV and the rapid development of drug-resistant strains are driving the urgent search for new direct-acting antiviral agents. A new class of agents has recently been developed that are believed to target the HCV protein NS5A although precisely where they interact and how they affect function is unknown. Here we describe an invitro assay based on microscale thermophoresis and demonstrate that two clinically relevant inhibitors bind tightly to NS5A domain 1 and inhibit RNA binding. Conversely, RNA binding inhibits compound binding. The compounds bind more weakly to known resistance mutants L31V and Y93H. The compounds do not affect NS5A dimerisation. We propose that current NS5A inhibitors act by favouring a dimeric structure of NS5A that does not bind RNA.},

We devised and validated an autocompetitive strategy to independently fit the concentration and dissociation constant of autoimmune antibodies against the cardiac ?1-adrenergic receptor related to dilated cardiomyopathy. As an artificial antigen, the peptide COR1 was designed to mimic the second extracellular receptor loop.

abstract = {The majority of proteins that are secreted across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane leave the cell via the Sec pathway, which in its minimal form consists of the dimeric ATP-driven motor protein SecA that associates with the protein-conducting membrane pore SecYEG. Some Gram-positive bacteria contain two homologues of SecA, termed SecA1 and SecA2. SecA1 is the essential housekeeping protein, whereas SecA2 is not essential but is involved in the translocation of a subset of proteins, including various virulence factors. Some SecA2 containing bacteria also harbor a homologous SecY2 protein that may form a separate translocase. Interestingly, mycobacteria contain only one SecY protein and thus both SecA1 and SecA2 are required to interact with SecYEG, either individually or together as a heterodimer. In order to address whether SecA1 and SecA2 cooperate during secretion of SecA2 dependent proteins, we examined the oligomeric state of SecA1 and SecA2 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and their interactions with SecA2 and the cognate SecA1, respectively. We conclude that both SecA1 and SecA2 individually form homodimers in solution but when both proteins are present simultaneously, they form dissociable heterodimers.},

abstract = {We describe a microfluidic all-optical technique to measure the thermophoresis of molecules. Within micrometer-thick chambers, we heat aqueous solutions with a micrometer-sized focus of infrared light. The temperature increase of about 1 K is monitored with temperature-sensitive fluorescent dyes. We test the approach in measuring the thermophoresis of DNA. We image the concentration of DNA in a second fluorescence-color channel. DNA is depleted away from the heated spot. The profile of depletion is fitted by the thermophoretic theory to reveal the Soret coefficient. We evaluate the method with numerical 3D calculations of temperature profiles, drift, convection and thermophoretic depletion using finite element methods. The approach opens new ways to monitor thermophoresis at the single molecule level, near boundaries and in complex mixtures. The flexible microfluidic setting is a good step towards microfluidic applications of thermophoresis in biotechnology.},

abstract = {Molecular motors of the myosin superfamily share a generic motor domain region. They commonly bind actin in an ATP-sensitive manner, exhibit actin-activated ATPase activity, and generate force and movement in this interaction. Class-18 myosins form heavy chain dimers and contain protein interaction domains located at their unique N-terminal extension. Here, we characterized human myosin-18A molecular function in the interaction with nucleotides, F-actin and its putative binding partner, the Golgi-associated phosphoprotein GOLPH3. We show that myosin 18A comprises two actin binding sites: one is located in the KE-rich region at the start of the N-terminal extension and appears to mediate ATP-independent binding to F-actin. The second actin-binding site resides in the generic motor domain and is regulated by nucleotide binding in the absence of intrinsic ATP hydrolysis competence. This core motor domain displays its highest actin affinity in the ADP state. Electron micrographs of myosin-18A motor domain-decorated F-actin filaments show periodic binding pattern independent of the nucleotide state. We show that the PDZ module mediates direct binding of myosin-18A to GOLPH3 and this interaction in turn modulates the actin binding properties of the N-terminal extension. Thus, myosin-18A can act as an actin-crosslinker with multiple regulatory modulators that targets interacting proteins or complexes to the actin-based cytoskeleton.},

abstract = {A single-subunit RNA polymerase, POLRMT, transcribes the mitochondrial genome in human cells. Recently, a factor termed as the mitochondrial transcription elongation factor, TEFM, was shown to stimulate transcription elongation in vivo, but its effect in vitro was relatively modest. In the current work, we have isolated active TEFM in recombinant form and used a reconstituted in vitro transcription system to characterize its activities. We show that TEFM strongly promotes POLRMT processivity as it dramatically stimulates the formation of longer transcripts. TEFM also abolishes premature transcription termination at conserved sequence block II, an event that has been linked to primer formation during initiation of mtDNA synthesis. We show that POLRMT pauses at a wide range of sites in a given DNA sequence. In the absence of TEFM, this leads to termination; however, the presence of TEFM abolishes this effect and aids POLRMT in continuation of transcription. Further, we show that TEFM substantially increases the POLRMT affinity to an elongation-like DNA:RNA template. In combination with previously published in vivo observations, our data establish TEFM as an essential component of the mitochondrial transcription machinery.},

abstract = {p97, also known as valosin-containing protein, is a versatile participant in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. p97 interacts with a large network of adaptor proteins to process ubiquitylated substrates in different cellular pathways, including endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation and transcription factor activation. p97 and its adaptor Fas-associated factor-1 (FAF1) both have roles in the ubiquitin-proteasome system during NF-$\kappa$B activation, although the mechanisms are unknown. FAF1 itself also has emerging roles in other cell-cycle pathways and displays altered expression levels in various cancer cell lines. We have performed a detailed study the p97-FAF1 interaction. We show that FAF1 binds p97 stably and in a stoichiometry of 3 to 6. Cryo-EM analysis of p97-FAF1 yielded a 17 {\AA} reconstruction of the complex with FAF1 above the p97 ring. Characteristics of p97-FAF1 uncovered in this study reveal common features in the interactions of p97, providing mechanistic insight into how p97 mediates diverse functionalities.},

Previously, a recombinant type I-A Cascade complex from the archaeon Thermoproteus tenax was shown to target and degrade DNA in vitro, dependent on a native PAM sequence. Here, we present the biochemical analysis of the small subunit, Csa5, of this Cascade complex. T. tenax Csa5 preferentially bound ssDNA and mutants that showed decreased ssDNA-binding and reduced Cascade-mediated DNA cleavage were identified. Csa5 oligomerization prevented DNA binding. Specific recognition of the PAM sequence was not observed. Phylogenetic analyses identified Csa5 as a universal member of type I-A systems and revealed three distinct groups. A potential role of Csa5 in R-loop stabilization is discussed.},

abstract = {Measuring parameters such as stability and conformation of biomolecules, especially of nucleic acids, is important in the field of biology, medical diagnostics and biotechnology. We present a thermophoretic method to analyse the conformation and thermal stability of nucleic acids. It relies on the directed movement of molecules in a temperature gradient that depends on surface characteristics of the molecule, such as size, charge and hydrophobicity. By measuring thermophoresis of nucleic acids over temperature, we find clear melting transitions and resolve intermediate conformational states. These intermediate states are indicated by an additional peak in the thermophoretic signal preceding most melting transitions. We analysed single nucleotide polymorphisms, DNA modifications, conformational states of DNA hairpins and microRNA duplexes. The method is validated successfully against calculated melting temperatures and UV absorbance measurements. Interestingly, the methylation of DNA is detected by the thermophoretic amplitude even if it does not affect the melting temperature. In the described setup, thermophoresis is measured all-optical in a simple setup using a reproducible capillary format with only 250 nl probe consumption. The thermophoretic analysis of nucleic acids shows the technique's versatility for the investigation of nucleic acids relevant in cellular processes like RNA interference or gene silencing.},

abstract = {A new antimicrobial peptide l-RW containing double amphipathic binding sequences was designed, and its biological activities were investigated in the present study. L-RW showed antibacterial activity against several bacterial strains but low cytotoxicity to mammalian cells and low hemolytic activity to red blood cells, which makes it a potential and promising peptide for further development. Microscale thermophoresis (MST), a new technique, was applied to study the antimicrobial peptide–lipid interaction for the first time, which examined the binding affinities of this new antimicrobial peptide to various lipids, including different phospholipids, mixture lipids and bacterial lipid extracts. The results demonstrated that l-RW bound preferentially to negatively charged lipids over neutral lipids, which was consistent with the biological activities, revealing the important role of electrostatic interaction in the binding process. L-RW also showed higher binding affinity for lipid extract from Staphyloccocus aureus compared with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, which were in good agreement with the higher antibacterial activity against S. aureus than P. aeruginosa and E. coli, suggesting that the binding affinity is capable to predict the antibacterial activity to some extent. Additionally, the binding of l-RW to phospholipids was also performed in fetal bovine serum solution by MST, which revealed that the components in biological solution may have interference with the binding event. The results proved that MST is a useful and potent tool in antimicrobial peptide–lipid interaction investigation.

abstract = {Calcium (Ca(2+)) signaling is a universal mechanism of signal transduction and involves Ca(2+) signal formation and decoding of information by Ca(2+) binding proteins. Calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs), which upon Ca(2+) binding activate CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) regulate a multitude of physiological processes in plants. Here, we combine phylogenomics and functional analyses to investigate the occurrence and structural conservation of CBL and CIPK proteins in 26 species representing all major clades of eukaryotes. We demonstrate the presence of at least singular CBL-CIPK pairs in representatives of Archaeplastida, Chromalveolates and Excavates and their general absence in Opisthokonta and Amoebozoa. This denotes CBL-CIPK complexes as evolutionary ancient Ca(2+) signaling modules that likely evolved in the ancestor of all Bikonta. Furthermore, we functionally characterize the CBLs and CIPK from the parabasalid human pathogen Trichomonas vaginalis. Our results reveal strict evolutionary conservation of functionally important structural features, preservation of biochemical properties and a remarkable cross-kingdom protein-protein interaction potential between CBLs and CIPKs from Arabidopsis thaliana and T. vaginalis. Together our findings suggest an ancient evolutionary origin of a functional CBL-CIPK signaling module close to the root of eukaryotic evolution and provide insights into the initial evolution of signaling networks and Ca(2+) signaling specificity.},

abstract = {A crucial bottleneck in membrane protein studies, particularly G-protein coupled receptors, is the notorious difficulty of finding an optimal detergent that can solubilize them and maintain their stability and function. Here we report rapid production of 12 unique mammalian olfactory receptors using short designer lipid-like peptides as detergents. The peptides were able to solubilize and stabilize each receptor. Circular dichroism showed that the purified olfactory receptors had alpha-helical secondary structures. Microscale thermophoresis suggested that the receptors were functional and bound their odorants. Blot intensity measurements indicated that milligram quantities of each olfactory receptor could be produced with at least one peptide detergent. The peptide detergents' capability was comparable to that of the detergent Brij-35. The ability of 10 peptide detergents to functionally solubilize 12 olfactory receptors demonstrates their usefulness as a new class of detergents for olfactory receptors, and possibly other G-protein coupled receptors and membrane proteins.},

abstract = {High-temperature requirement A1 (HTRA1) is a secreted serine protease reported to play a role in the development of several cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Still, the mechanism underlying the disease processes largely remains undetermined. In age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a common cause of vision impairment and blindness in industrialized societies, two synonymous polymorphisms (rs1049331:C>T, and rs2293870:G>T) in exon 1 of the HTRA1 genewere associated with a high risk to develop disease. Here, we show that the two polymorphisms result in a protein with altered thermophoretic properties upon heat-induced unfolding, trypsin accessibility and secretion behavior, suggesting unique structural features of the AMD-risk-associated HTRA1 protein. Applying MicroScale Thermophoresis and protease digestion analysis, we demonstrate direct binding and proteolysis of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) by normal HTRA1 but not the AMD-risk-associated isoform. As a consequence, both HTRA1 isoforms strongly differed in their ability to control TGF-beta mediated signaling, as revealed by reporter assays targeting the TGF-beta 1-induced serpin peptidase inhibitor (SERPINE1, alias PAI-1) promoter. In addition, structurally altered HTRA1 led to an impaired autocrine TGF-beta signaling in microglia, as measured by a strong down-regulation of downstream effectors of the TGF-beta cascade such as phosphorylated SMAD2 and PAI-1 expression. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the effects of two synonymous HTRA1 variants on protein structure and protein interaction with TGF-beta 1. As a consequence, this leads to an impairment of TGF-beta signaling and microglial regulation. Functional implications of the altered properties on AMD pathogenesis remain to be clarified.},

Recently, nano differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) has emerged as a powerful tool for thermal stability analysis and studies of protein domain unfolding. Due to increased interests in the qualification of characterization methods, we are in this study presenting the qualification results for the comparability studies of thermal stability analysis using nanoDSF. The results show that nanoDSF is able to detect thermal transition signals for mAbs, BiTE{\textregistered} molecules, and cytokines at a wide concentration range with high precision, clearly indicating that nanoDSF is suitable for characterization including comparability studies of therapeutic proteins. Compared to the current recognized industry standard DSC, the nanoDSF method enables thermal stability analysis over a much wider concentration range, consumes considerably less materials, and provides significantly higher throughput.},

abstract = {Amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered to be mediated by phosphorylated tau protein. In contrast, we found that, at least in early disease, site-specific phosphorylation of tau inhibited A$\beta$ toxicity. This specific tau phosphorylation was mediated by the neuronal p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase p38$\gamma$ and interfered with postsynaptic excitotoxic signaling complexes engaged by A$\beta$. Accordingly, depletion of p38$\gamma$ exacerbated neuronal circuit aberrations, cognitive deficits, and premature lethality in a mouse model of AD, whereas increasing the activity of p38$\gamma$ abolished these deficits. Furthermore, mimicking site-specific tau phosphorylation alleviated A$\beta$-induced neuronal death and offered protection from excitotoxicity. Our work provides insights into postsynaptic processes in AD pathogenesis and challenges a purely pathogenic role of tau phosphorylation in neuronal toxicity.},

@article{Pross2020,
abstract = {During their synthesis the C-tailed membrane proteins expose the membrane-spanning segment late from the ribosome and consequently can insert into the membrane only post-translationally. However, the C-tailed T6SS component SciP uses the bacterial SRP system for membrane targeting which operates co-translationally. Analysis of possible sequence regions in the amino-terminal part of the protein revealed two candidates that were then tested whether they function as SRP signal peptides. Both sequences were tested positive as synthetic peptides for binding to SRP. In addition, purified ribosomes with stalled nascent chains exposing either sequence were capable to bind to SRP and to SRP-FtsY complexes with high affinity. Together, the data suggest that both peptides can serve as SRP signal sequence promoting an early membrane targeting of SciP during its synthesis. Like observed for multi-spanning membrane proteins, the two cytoplasmic SRP signal sequences of SciP may also facilitate a re-targeting event, making the targeting more efficient. Importance C-tail proteins are anchored in the inner membrane with a transmembrane segment at the C-terminus in a N-in/C-out topology. Due to this topology the membrane insertion occurs only post-translationally. Nevertheless, the C-tail anchored protein SciP is targeted co-translationally by SRP. We report here that two cytoplasmic hydrophobic stretches in SciP are individually recognized by SRP and target the nascent protein to FtsY. The presence of two signal sequences may enable a re-targeting mechanism as already observed for multi-spanning membrane proteins, to make the post-translational insertion of SciP by YidC more efficient.},

abstract = {Co-translational protein targeting to membranes depends on the regulated interaction of two ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs): the ribosome and the signal recognition particle (SRP). Human SRP is composed of an SRP RNA and six proteins with the SRP GTPase SRP54 forming the targeting complex with the heterodimeric SRP receptor (SR) at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. While detailed structural and functional data are available especially for the bacterial homologs, the analysis of human SRP was impeded by the unavailability of recombinant SRP. Here, we describe the large-scale production of all human SRP components and the reconstitution of homogeneous SRP and SR complexes. Binding to human ribosomes is determined by microscale thermophoresis for individual components, assembly intermediates and entire SRP, and binding affinities are correlated with structural information available for all ribosomal contacts. We show that SRP RNA does not bind to the ribosome, while SRP binds with nanomolar affinity involving a two-step mechanism of the key-player SRP54. Ultrasensitive binding of SRP68/72 indicates avidity by multiple binding sites that are dominated by the C-terminus of SRP72. Our data extend the experimental basis to understand the mechanistic principles of co-translational targeting in mammals and may guide analyses of complex RNP–RNP interactions in general.},

abstract = {The potent antiretroviral protein APOBEC3G (A3G) specifically targets and deaminates deoxycytidine nucleotides, generating deoxyuridine, in single stranded DNA (ssDNA) intermediates produced during HIV replication. A non-catalytic domain in A3G binds strongly to RNA, an interaction crucial for recruitment of A3G to the virion; yet, A3G displays no deamination activity for cytidines in viral RNA. Here, we report NMR and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis for interactions between A3Gctd and multiple substrate or non-substrate DNA and RNA, in combination with deamination assays. NMR ssDNA-binding experiments revealed that the interaction with residues in helix1 and loop1 (T201-L220) distinguishes the binding mode of substrate ssDNA from non-substrate. Using 2-deoxy-2-fluorine substituted cytidines, we show that a 2-endo sugar conformation of the target deoxycytidine is favored for substrate binding and deamination. Trajectories of the MD simulation indicate that a ribose 2-hydroxyl group destabilizes the - stacking of the target cytosine and H257, resulting in dislocation of the target cytosine base from the catalytic position. Interestingly, APOBEC3A, which can deaminate ribocytidines, retains the ribocytidine in the catalytic position throughout the MD simulation. Our results indicate that A3Gctd catalytic selectivity against RNA is dictated by both the sugar conformation and 2- hydroxyl group.},

AcrIIA1 binds and inhibits Cas9 with its C-terminal domain; however, the function of its highly conserved N-terminal domain (NTD) is unknown. Here, we report that the AcrIIA1NTD is a critical transcriptional repressor of the strong anti-CRISPR promoter. A rapid burst of anti-CRISPR transcription occurs during phage infection and the subsequent negative feedback by AcrIIA1NTD is required for optimal phage replication, even in the absence of CRISPR-Cas immunity. In the presence of CRISPR-Cas immunity, full-length AcrIIA1 uses its two-domain architecture to act as a “Cas9 sensor,” tuning acr expression according to Cas9 levels. Finally, we identify AcrIIA1NTD homologs in other Firmicutes and demonstrate that they have been co-opted by hosts as “anti-anti-CRISPRs,” repressing phage anti-CRISPR deployment.},

The focus of this study is the production of the high-value aromatic ester cinnamyl cinnamate, which can be applied in flavors and fragrances. A three-enzyme cascade was established to realize the synthesis, starting from the corresponding aldehyde with in situ cofactor regeneration in a two-phase system. After characterization of the enzymes, a screening with di erent organic solvents was carried out, whereby xylene was found to be the most suitable solvent for the second phase. The reaction stability of the formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from Candida boidinii is the limiting step during cofactor regeneration. However, the applied enzyme cascade showed an overall yield of 54%. After successful application on lab scale, the limitation by the FDH was overcome by immobilization of the enzymes and an optimized downstream process, transferring the cascade into a miniplant. The upscaling resulted in an increased yield for the esterification, as well as overall yields of 37%.},

abstract = {The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer is located on the surface of the virus and is the target of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). Recombinant native-like soluble Env trimer mimetics, such as SOSIP trimers, have taken a central role in HIV-1 vaccine research aimed at inducing bNAbs. We therefore performed a direct and thorough comparison of a full-length unmodified Env trimer containing the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail, with the sequence matched soluble SOSIP trimer, both based on an early Env sequence (AMC011) from an HIV+ individual that developed bNAbs. The structures of the full-length AMC011 trimer bound to either bNAb PGT145 or PGT151 were very similar to the structures of SOSIP trimers. Antigenically, the full-length and SOSIP trimers were comparable, but in contrast to the full-length trimer, the SOSIP trimer did not bind at all to non-neutralizing antibodies, most likely as a consequence of the intrinsic stabilization of the SOSIP trimer. Furthermore, the glycan composition of full-length and SOSIP trimers was similar overall, but the SOSIP trimer possessed slightly less complex and less extensively processed glycans, which may relate to the intrinsic stabilization as well as the absence of the membrane tether. These data provide insights into how to best use and improve membrane-associated full-length and soluble SOSIP HIV-1 Env trimers as immunogens.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic cell homeostasis requires transfer of cellular components among organelles and relies on membrane fusion catalyzed by SNARE proteins. Inactive SNARE bundles are reactivated by hexameric N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, vesicle-fusing ATPase (Sec18/NSF)-driven disassembly that enables a new round of membrane fusion. We previously found that phosphatidic acid (PA) binds Sec18 and thereby sequesters it from SNAREs and that PA dephosphorylation dissociates Sec18 from the membrane, allowing it to engage SNARE complexes. We now report that PA also induces conformational changes in Sec18 protomers and that hexameric Sec18 cannot bind PA membranes. Molecular dynamics (MD) analyses revealed that the D1 and D2 domains of Sec18 contain PA-binding sites and that the residues needed for PA binding are masked in hexameric Sec18. Importantly, these simulations also disclosed that a major conformational change occurs in the linker region between the D1 and D2 domains, which is distinct from the conformational changes that occur in hexameric Sec18 during SNARE priming. Together, these findings indicate that PA regulates Sec18 function by altering its architecture and stabilizing membrane-bound Sec18 protomers.},

The affinities between the loop of MBs and the complementary ssDNAs in the binding system were varied, determined and optimized by MST in the presence or absence of Hg2+. It suggested that the relative low background could be obtained when the number of mismatches of ssDNA was four and in the present of Hg2+ displayed strong recovery of fluorescence. The lowest detection limit of Hg2+ was 3 nM which was below the maximum contaminant level defined by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (10 nM). The working range was 5–320 nM with negligible possible interference from the different background composition of water samples by optimization of the binding conditions. Through evaluating by MST, the molecular interaction mechanism was elaborated and the rapid, sensitive and selective detection of Hg2+ was achieved by the designed MB-binding system. It herein has great potential for appraising and analyzing molecular interaction among the interactants.},

abstract = {The structural transition and misfolding of human islet amyloid polypeptide may cause a common metabolic disease Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Seventeen peptides have been synthesized, possessing different lengths, compositions, and peptide conformation. In this study, the mechanism of these peptides on inhibiting the formation of hIAPP11–20 amyloid fibrils was investigated using a conventional ThT fluorescence assay and microscale thermophoresis. The results showed that short peptides AT, SA, RF, KS, KT and KN, and cyclic peptides cyclic-KS, cyclic-KT and cyclic-KN displayed considerable inhibitory effect on hIAPP11–20 fibril formation and a strong affinity for hIAPP11–20. The detailed investigation indicated that the phenylalanine residue and some special peptide composition significantly inhibit amyloid formation. The peptide conformation of the designed peptide inhibitors may also play an important role. Microscale thermophoresis quantified the binding affinities between hIAPP11–20 and the peptides; and revealed that high affinity binding more likely leads to inhibiting fibril formation of hIAPP11–20 and vice versa, which is in accordance with the results from the ThT assays. These findings suggest a feasible model of peptide inhibitor design for inhibiting amyloid formation. In addition, microscale thermophoresis was proven as a promising rapid method for preliminarily screening inhibitors of hIAPP11–20.},

The discovery of camelid antibodies in the 1990s has extended the useful range of antibodies into pH extremes, high temperature, and high salt conditions due to increased stability. However, determining the binding properties of these molecules prior to use under these conditions has not been widely employed because the most precise biophysical methods, surface plasmon resonance, and isothermal titration calorimetry, are not compatible with highly complex matrices. Here we demonstrate the use of microscale thermophoresis as a rapid, simple method to detect binding of a single-domain antibody in the presence of jet fuel/water mixes; a complex, harsh environment.

The present article reports on a fast-track assessment platform for rapid investigation of therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with minimal sample concentration, volume, and preparation. The proposed nanoDSF platform has been demonstrated for rapid assessment of two commercial IgG 1 drug products (DP), trastuzumab and rituximab, and their biosimilars with respect to their conformational and colloidal stability. Domain specific differences for each of the IgGs have been elucidated with respect to onset of domain unfolding (Tonset) and melting temperatures. These thermal unfolding and transition midpoint (Tm) measurements are based on the intrinsic aromatic amino acid residue fluorescence of proteins. Moreover, to understand the possibility of nanoDSF as a predictive tool, data from nanoDSF has been correlated with accelerated stability studies. Melting temperatures across brands were found to be highly comparable to the rate of heating, thereby exhibiting a significant domain specific effect on melting temperatures for both trastuzumab and rituximab. Conservation of higher order structure (HOS) through reversible unfolding was also examined and both the mAbs were found to regain tertiary structure up till the first transition midpoint. No clear correlation was found between formation of higher molecular weight species (HMWS) and unfolding parameters (Tonset and Tagg) for accelerated stability studies. Finally, a discussion on the need for fast predictive assessment of conformation and colloidal stability as well as a comparison of advantages and limitations of the technique with routine/classical tools such as circular dichroism spectrophotometry and differential scanning calorimetry has been presented.},

In response to falling nitrate levels, NRT1.1 is phosphorylated on an intracellular threonine that switches the transporter from a low to high affinity state. Here we present both the apo and nitrate bound crystal structures of Arabidopsis thaliana NRT1.1, which together with in vitro binding and transport data identify a key role for His356 in nitrate binding. Our data support a model whereby phosphorylation increases structural flexibility and in turn the rate of transport. Comparison with peptide transporters further reveals how the NRT1/PTR family has evolved to recognize diverse nitrogenous ligands, whilst maintaining elements of a conserved coupling mechanism within this superfamily of nutrient transporters.},

The current dogma states that DHDPS from Gram-negative bacteria are inhibited by lysine but orthologs from Gram-positive species are not. The 1.65-A resolution structure of the Gram-negative Legionella pneumophila DHDPS and the 1.88-A resolution structure of the Gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae DHDPS bound to lysine, together with comprehensive functional analyses, show that this dogma is incorrect. We subsequently employed our crystallographic data with bioinformatics, mutagenesis, enzyme kinetics, and microscale thermophoresis to reveal that lysine-mediated inhibition is not defined by Gram staining, but by the presence of a His or Glu at position 56 (Escherichia coli numbering). This study has unveiled the molecular determinants defining lysine-mediated allosteric inhibition of bacterial DHDPS.},

However, the association/dissociation constant of MUC4-ErbB2 complex is unknown. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have become a major area of research in the past years and the characterization of their interactions, especially by biophysical methods, is intensively used in drug discovery. To characterize the MUC4-ErbB2 interaction, we used MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST), a powerful method for quantitative protein interaction analysis under challenging conditions. We worked with CHO cell lysates containing either the transmembrane $\beta$ subunit of MUC4 (MUC4$\beta$) or a truncated mutant encompassing only the EGF domains (MUC4EGF3+1+2). MST studies have led to the characterization of equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for MUC4$\beta$-ErbB2 (7–25 nM) and MUC4EGF3+1+2/ErbB2 (65–79 nM) complexes. This work provides new information regarding the MUC4-ErbB2 interaction at the biophysical level and also confirms that the presence of the three EGF domains of MUC4 is sufficient to provide efficient interaction. This technological approach will be very useful in the future to validate small molecule binding affinities targeting MUC4-ErbB2 complex for drug discovery development in cancer. It will also be of high interest for the other known membrane mucins forming oncogenic complexes with ErbBs at the cancer cell surface.},

abstract = {Genome editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been used to make precise heritable changes in the DNA of organisms. Although the widely used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) and its engineered variants have been efficiently harnessed for numerous gene-editing applications across different platforms, concerns remain regarding their putative off-targeting at multiple loci across the genome. Here we report that Francisella novicida Cas9 (FnCas9) shows a very high specificity of binding to its intended targets and negligible binding to off-target loci. The specificity is determined by its minimal binding affinity with DNA when mismatches to the target single-guide RNA (sgRNA) are present in the sgRNA:DNA heteroduplex. FnCas9 produces staggered cleavage, higher homology-directed repair rates, and very low nonspecific genome editing compared to SpCas9. We demonstrate FnCas9-mediated correction of the sickle cell mutation in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and propose that it can be used for precise therapeutic genome editing for a wide variety of genetic disorders.},

abstract = {Synaptotagmin-1 is the main Ca(2+) sensor of neuronal exocytosis. It binds to both Ca(2+) and the anionic phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)), but the precise cooperativity of this binding is still poorly understood. Here, we used microscale thermophoresis to quantify the cooperative binding of PIP(2) and Ca(2+) to synaptotagmin-1. We found that PIP(2) bound to the well conserved polybasic patch of the C2B domain with an apparent dissociation constant of ∼20 $\mu$M. PIP(2) binding reduced the apparent dissociation constant for Ca(2+) from ∼250 to <5 $\mu$M. Thus, our data show that PIP(2) makes synaptotagmin-1 >40-fold more sensitive to Ca(2+). This interplay between Ca(2+), synaptotagmin-1, and PIP(2) is crucial for neurotransmitter release.},

abstract = {Inorganic phosphate is the major bioavailable form of the essential nutrient phosphorus. However, the concentration of phosphate in most natural habitats is low enough to limit microbial growth. Under phosphate-depleted conditions some bacteria utilise phosphite and hypophosphite as alternative sources of phosphorus, but the molecular basis of reduced phosphorus acquisition from the environment is not fully understood. Here, we present crystal structures and ligand binding affinities of periplasmic binding proteins from bacterial phosphite and hypophosphite ATP-binding cassette transporters. We reveal that phosphite and hypophosphite specificity results from a combination of steric selection and the presence of a P-H{\ldots}$\pi$ interaction between the ligand and a conserved aromatic residue in the ligand-binding pocket. The characterisation of high affinity and specific transporters has implications for the marine phosphorus redox cycle, and might aid the use of phosphite as an alternative phosphorus source in biotechnological, industrial and agricultural applications.},
