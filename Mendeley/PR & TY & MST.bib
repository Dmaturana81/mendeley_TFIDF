abstract = {Lactate dehydrogenases (LDHs) are tetrameric enzymes of major significance in cancer metabolism as well as promising targets for cancer therapy. However, their wide and polar catalytic sites make them a challenging target for orthosteric inhibition. In this work, we conceived to target LDH tetramerization sites with the ambition of disrupting their oligomeric state. To do so, we designed a protein model of a dimeric LDH-H. We exploited this model through WaterLOGSY nuclear magnetic resonance and microscale thermophoresis for the identification and characterization of a set of $\alpha$-helical peptides and stapled derivatives that specifically targeted the LDH tetramerization sites. This strategy resulted in the design of a macrocyclic peptide that competes with the LDH tetramerization domain, thus disrupting and destabilizing LDH tetramers. These peptides and macrocycles, along with the dimeric model of LDH-H, constitute promising pharmacological tools for the de novo design and identification of LDH tetramerization disruptors. Overall, our study demonstrates that disrupting LDH oligomerization state by targeting their tetramerization sites is achievable and paves the way toward LDH inhibition through this novel molecular mechanism.},

abstract = {Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) constitute a superfamily of NAD(P)+-dependent enzymes, which detoxify aldehydes produced in various metabolic pathways to the corresponding carboxylic acids. Among the 19 human ALDHs, the cytosolic ALDH9A1 has so far never been fully enzymatically characterized and its structure is still unknown. Here, we report complete molecular and kinetic properties of human ALDH9A1 as well as three crystal forms at 2.3, 2.9, and 2.5 ˚A resolution. We show that ALDH9A1 exhibits wide substrate specificity to aminoaldehydes, aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes with a clear preference for $\gamma$-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde (TMABAL). The structure of ALDH9A1 reveals that the enzyme assembles as a tetramer. Each ALDH monomer displays a typical ALDHs fold composed of an oligomerization domain, a coenzyme domain, a catalytic domain, and an inter-domain linker highly conserved in amino-acid sequence and folding. Nonetheless, structural comparison reveals a position and a fold of the inter-domain linker of ALDH9A1 never observed in any other ALDH so far. This unique difference is not compatible with the presence of a bound substrate and a large conformational rearrangement of the linker up to 30 ˚A has to occur to allow the access of the substrate channel. Moreover, the $\alpha$$\beta$E region consisting of an $\alpha$-helix and a $\beta$-strand of the coenzyme domain at the dimer interface are disordered, likely due to the loss of interactions with the inter-domain linker, which leads to incomplete $\beta$-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) binding pocket.
