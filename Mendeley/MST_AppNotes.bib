abstract = {Aptamers are single-stranded oligonucleotides which fold into a three-dimensional structure allowing the specific recognition of a molecular target. Therefore, they might be an alternative to antibodies as detection molecules in biosensors. Aptamers are well suited for this application since they can be directed against almost every molecular target, and show high binding affinities to their corresponding binding partner. Aptamers with a terminal amino-group can be coupled to organic or inorganic fluorophores via amide bonds to enable their optical detection. In this study Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)-binding aptamers were conjugated with quantum dot molecules. This immobilization may inhibit the correct aptamer folding and consequently lead to a declined target-binding activity. Therefore, MST technology was used to determine whether quantum dot conjugation affects the VEGF-binding affinity of aptamers.},

Here we demonstrate the utility of a RED-tris-NTA dye from NanoTemper Technologies that can be used to specifically label His-tagged proteins for MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) binding studies directly in cell lysates. The procedure requires minute amounts of sample, can be carried out without additional lab equipment and accurate Kd measurements are obtained within 45 minutes from cell lysis to measurement. As an example, we measured the affinity of a small molecule inhibitor to His-tagged p38$\alpha$ kinase expressed in mammalian cells. Our data demonstrate that MST assays are a rapid and cost-effective method for determination of affinities using unpurified proteins, and thus serves as a powerful tool in the early drug discovery, especially for proteins that are difficult to purify.},
